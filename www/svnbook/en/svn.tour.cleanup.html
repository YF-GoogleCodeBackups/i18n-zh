<p>Now that we've covered the day-to-day tasks that you'll
      frequently use Subversion for, we'll review a few administrative
      tasks relating to your working copy.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cleanup.disposal"></a>2.6.1. Disposing of a Working Copy</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Subversion doesn't track either the state or the existence of
        working copies on the server, so there's no server overhead to
        keeping working copies around.  Likewise, there's no need to
        let the server know that you're going to delete a working
        copy.</p>
<p>If you're likely to use a working copy again, there's
        nothing wrong with just leaving it on disk until you're ready
        to use it again, at which point all it takes is an
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring it up to date and ready
        for use.</p>
<p>However, if you're definitely not going to use a working
        copy again, you can safely delete the entire thing, but you'd
        be well served to take a look through the working copy for
        unversioned files.  To find these files, run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        status</code></strong> and review any files that are prefixed with a
        <code class="literal">?</code> to make certain that they're not of
        importance.  After you're done reviewing, you can safely
        delete your working copy.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cleanup.interruption"></a>2.6.2. Recovering from an Interruption</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When Subversion modifies your working copy (or any
        information within <code class="filename">.svn</code>), it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing the working copy,
        Subversion writes its intentions to a logfile.  Next, it
        executes the commands in the logfile to apply the requested
        change, holding a lock on the relevant part of the working
        copy while it works—to prevent other Subversion clients
        from accessing the working copy mid-change.  Finally,
        Subversion removes the logfile.  Architecturally, this is
        similar to a journaled filesystem.  If a Subversion operation
        is interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or if the machine
        crashes), the logfiles remain on disk.  By
        reexecuting the logfiles, Subversion can complete the
        previously started operation, and your working copy can get
        itself back into a consistent state.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what <span class="command"><strong>svn cleanup</strong></span>
        does: it searches your working copy and runs any leftover
        logs, removing working copy locks in the process.
        If Subversion ever tells you that some part of your working copy
        is “<span class="quote">locked,</span>” this is the command that you
        should run.  Also, <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> will display
        an <code class="literal">L</code> next to locked items:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status
  L    somedir
M      somedir/foo.c

$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M      somedir/foo.c
</pre>
<p>Don't confuse these working copy locks with the ordinary
        locks that Subversion users create when using
        the lock-modify-unlock model of concurrent
        version control; see the sidebar
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.locking.html#svn.advanced.locking.meanings" title="The Three Meanings of Lock">The Three Meanings of Lock</a> for
        clarification.</p>
