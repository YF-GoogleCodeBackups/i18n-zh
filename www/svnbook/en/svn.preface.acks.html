<p>This book would not be possible (nor very useful) if
      Subversion did not exist.  For that, the authors would like to
      thank Brian Behlendorf and CollabNet for the vision to fund such
      a risky and ambitious new open source project; Jim Blandy for
      the original Subversion name and design—we love you, Jim;
      and Karl Fogel for being such a good friend and a great
      community leader, in that order.

<p>Thanks to O'Reilly and our various editors: Chuck Toporek, Linda
      Mui, Tatiana Apandi, Mary Brady, and Mary Treseler.  Their patience and support
      has been tremendous.</p>
<p>Finally, we thank the countless people who contributed to
      this book with informal reviews, suggestions, and patches.
      While this is undoubtedly not a complete list, this book would
      be incomplete and incorrect without their help:

<a name="svn.preface.acks.sussman"></a>6.1. From Ben Collins-Sussman</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Thanks to my wife Frances, who, for many months, got to
        hear “<span class="quote">But honey, I'm still working on the book,</span>”
        rather than the usual “<span class="quote">But honey, I'm still doing
        email.</span>”  I don't know where she gets all that patience!
        She's my perfect counterbalance.</p>
<p>Thanks to my extended family and friends for their sincere
        encouragement, despite having no actual interest in the
        subject.  (You know, the ones who say, “<span class="quote">Ooh, you wrote a
        book?</span>” and then when you tell them it's a computer
        book, sort of glaze over.)</p>
<p>Thanks to all my close friends, who make me a rich, rich man.
        Don't look at me that way—you know who you are.</p>
<p>Thanks to my parents for the perfect low-level formatting
        and being unbelievable role models.  Thanks to my kids for the
        opportunity to pass that on.</p>

<a name="svn.preface.acks.fitz"></a>6.2. From Brian W. Fitzpatrick</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Huge thanks to my wife Marie for being incredibly
        understanding, supportive, and most of all, patient.  Thank
        you to my brother Eric who first introduced me to Unix
        programming way back when.  Thanks to my Mom and Grandmother
        for all their support, not to mention enduring a Christmas
        holiday where I came home and promptly buried my head in my
        laptop to work on the book.</p>
<p>To Mike and Ben:  it was a pleasure working with you on the
        book.  Heck, it's a pleasure working with you at work!</p>
<p>To everyone in the Subversion community and the Apache
        Software Foundation, thanks for having me.  Not a day goes by
        where I don't learn something from at least one of you.
      </p>
<p>Lastly, thanks to my grandfather, who always told me that
        “<span class="quote">freedom equals responsibility.</span>” I couldn't agree
        more.</p>

<a name="svn.preface.acks.cmpilato"></a>6.3. From C. Michael Pilato</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Special thanks to Amy, my best friend and wife of more than
        ten incredible years, for her love and patient support, for
        putting up with the late nights, and for graciously enduring
        the version control processes I've imposed on her.  Don't
        worry, sweetheart—you'll be a TortoiseSVN wizard in no
        time!</p>
<p>Gavin, you're able to read half of the words in this book
        yourself now; sadly, it's the other half that provide the key
        concepts.  And sorry, Aidan — I couldn't find a way to
        work Disney/Pixar characters into the text.  But Daddy loves
        you both, and can't wait to teach you about programming.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad, thanks for your constant support and
        enthusiasm.  Mom- and Dad-in-law, thanks for all of the same
        <span class="emphasis"><em>plus</em></span> your fabulous daughter.</p>
<p>Hats off to Shep Kendall, through whom the world of
        computers was first opened to me; Ben Collins-Sussman, my
        tour guide through the open source world; Karl Fogel, you
        <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> my <code class="filename">.emacs</code>; Greg
        Stein, for oozing practical programming know-how; and Brian
        Fitzpatrick, for sharing this writing experience with me.
        To the many folks from whom I am constantly picking up new
        knowledge—keep dropping it!</p>
<p>Finally, to the One who perfectly demonstrates creative
        excellence—thank You.</p>
