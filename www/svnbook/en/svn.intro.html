<p>If you're eager to get Subversion up and running (and you
    enjoy learning by experimentation), this appendix will show you how
    to create a repository, import code, and then check it back out
    again as a working copy.  Along the way, we give links to the
    relevant chapters of this book.</p>

<p>Subversion is built on a portability layer called
      APR&#8212;the Apache Portable Runtime library.  The APR library
      provides all the interfaces that Subversion needs to function on
      different operating systems: disk access, network access, memory
      management, and so on.  While Subversion is able to use Apache
      as one of its network server programs, its dependence on APR
      <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span> mean that Apache is a required
      component.  APR is a standalone library usable by any
      application.  It does mean, however, that like Apache,
      Subversion clients and servers run on any operating system that
      the Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> server runs on: Windows,
      Linux, all flavors of BSD, Mac OS X, NetWare, and others.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get Subversion is to download a binary
      package built for your operating system.  Subversion's web site
      (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org</a>) often has these
      packages available for download, posted by volunteers.  The site
      usually contains graphical installer packages for users of
      Microsoft operating systems.  If you run a Unix-like operating
      system, you can use your system's native package distribution
      system (RPMs, DEBs, the ports tree, etc.) to get
      Subversion.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can build Subversion directly from source
      code, though it's not always an easy task. (If you're not
      experienced at building open source software packages, you're
      probably better off downloading a binary distribution instead!)
      From the Subversion web site, download the latest source code
      release.  After unpacking it, follow the instructions in
      the <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file to build it.  Note that a
      released source package may not contain everything you need to
      build a command-line client capable of talking to a remote
      repository.  Starting with Subversion 1.4 and later, the
      libraries Subversion depends on (apr, apr-util, and neon) are
      distributed in a separate source package suffixed
      with <code class="filename">-deps</code>.  These libraries are now common
      enough that they may already be installed on your system.  If
      not, you'll need to unpack the dependency package into the same
      directory where you unpacked the main Subversion source.
      Regardless, it's possible that you may want to fetch other
      optional dependencies such as Berkeley DB and possibly Apache
      <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span>.  If you want to do a complete build,
      make sure you have all of the packages documented in
      the <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file.</p>
<p>If you're one of those folks that likes to use bleeding-edge
      software, you can also get the Subversion source code from the
      Subversion repository in which it lives.  Obviously, you'll need
      to already have a Subversion client on hand to do this.  But
      once you do, you can check out a working copy of the Subversion source
      repository from <a class="ulink" href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/" target="_top">http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/</a>:
      <sup>[<a name="id536559" href="#ftn.id536559" class="footnote">60</a>]</sup>
    </p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subversion
A    subversion/HACKING
A    subversion/INSTALL
A    subversion/README
A    subversion/autogen.sh
A    subversion/build.conf
&#8230;
</pre>
<p>The preceding command will create a working copy of the
      latest (unreleased) Subversion source code into a subdirectory
      named <code class="filename">subversion</code> in your current working
      directory.  You can adjust that last argument as you see fit.
      Regardless of what you call the new working copy directory,
      though, after this operation completes, you will now have the
      Subversion source code.  Of course, you will still need to fetch
      a few helper libraries (apr, apr-util, etc.)&#8212;see the
      <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file in the top level of the
      working copy for details.</p>

<p>What follows is a quick tutorial that walks you through some
      basic Subversion configuration and operation.  When you finish
      it, you should have a general understanding of Subversion's
      typical usage.</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The examples used in this appendix assume that you have
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>, the Subversion command-line client,
        and <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span>, the administrative tool,
        ready to go on a Unix-like operating system.  (This tutorial
        also works at the Windows command-line prompt, assuming you
        make some obvious tweaks.)  We also assume you are using
        Subversion 1.2 or later (run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn --version</code></strong>
        to check.)</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Subversion stores all versioned data in a central
      repository.  To begin, create a new repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/repos
$ ls /var/svn/repos
conf/  dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README.txt
</pre>
<p>This command creates a new directory,
      <code class="filename">/var/svn/repos</code>, which contains a Subversion
      repository.  This new directory contains (among other things) a
      collection of database files.  You won't see your versioned
      files if you peek inside.  For more information about repository
      creation and maintenance, see <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.html" title="Chapter 5. Repository Administration">Chapter 5, <i>Repository Administration</i></a>.</p>
<p>Subversion has no concept of a &#8220;<span class="quote">project.</span>&#8221; The
      repository is just a virtual versioned filesystem, a large tree
      that can hold anything you wish.  Some administrators prefer to
      store only one project in a repository, and others prefer to
      store multiple projects in a repository by placing them into
      separate directories.  We discuss the merits of each approach
      in <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="5.2.1. Planning Your Repository Organization">Section 5.2.1, &#8220;Planning Your Repository Organization&#8221;</a>.
      Either way, the repository manages only files and directories,
      so it's up to humans to interpret particular directories as
      &#8220;<span class="quote">projects.</span>&#8221;  So while you might see references to
      projects throughout this book, keep in mind that we're only ever
      talking about some directory (or collection of directories) in
      the repository.</p>
<p>In this example, we assume you already have some sort
      of project (a collection of files and directories) that you wish
      to import into your newly created Subversion repository.  Begin
      by organizing your data into a single directory called
      <code class="filename">myproject</code> (or whatever you wish).  For
      reasons explained in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.html" title="Chapter 4. Branching and Merging">Chapter 4, <i>Branching and Merging</i></a>, your
      project's tree structure should contain three top-level
      directories named <code class="filename">branches</code>,
      <code class="filename">tags</code>, and <code class="filename">trunk</code>.  The
      <code class="filename">trunk</code> directory should contain all of your
      data, and the <code class="filename">branches</code> and
      <code class="filename">tags</code> directories should be empty:</p>
<pre class="screen">
/tmp/myproject/branches/
/tmp/myproject/tags/
/tmp/myproject/trunk/
                     foo.c
                     bar.c
                     Makefile
                     &#8230;
</pre>
<p>The <code class="filename">branches</code>, <code class="filename">tags</code>,
      and <code class="filename">trunk</code> subdirectories aren't actually
      required by Subversion.  They're merely a popular convention
      that you'll most likely want to use later on.</p>
<p>Once you have your tree of data ready to go, import it into
      the repository with the <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> command
      (see <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.html#svn.tour.importing" title="2.2. Getting Data into Your Repository">Section 2.2, &#8220;Getting Data into Your Repository&#8221;</a>):</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn import /tmp/myproject file:///var/svn/repos/myproject -m "initial import"
Adding         /tmp/myproject/branches
Adding         /tmp/myproject/tags
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/foo.c
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/bar.c
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/Makefile
&#8230;
Committed revision 1.
$ 
</pre>
<p>Now the repository contains this tree of data.  As mentioned
      earlier, you won't see your files by directly peeking into the
      repository;  they're all stored within a database.  But the
      repository's imaginary filesystem now contains a top-level
      directory named <code class="filename">myproject</code>, which in turn
      contains your data.</p>
<p>Note that the original <code class="filename">/tmp/myproject</code>
      directory is unchanged; Subversion is unaware of it.  (In fact,
      you can even delete that directory if you wish.)  To
      start manipulating repository data, you need to create a new
      &#8220;<span class="quote">working copy</span>&#8221; of the data, a sort of private
      workspace.  Ask Subversion to &#8220;<span class="quote">check out</span>&#8221; a working
      copy of the <code class="filename">myproject/trunk</code> directory in
      the repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos/myproject/trunk myproject
A  myproject/foo.c
A  myproject/bar.c
A  myproject/Makefile
&#8230;
Checked out revision 1.
</pre>
<p>Now you have a personal copy of part of the repository in a
      new directory named <code class="filename">myproject</code>.  You can edit
      the files in your working copy and then commit those changes
      back into the repository.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Enter your working copy and edit a file's
          contents.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn diff</code></strong> to see unified diff
          output of your changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn commit</code></strong> to commit the new
          version of your file to the repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong> to bring your working
          copy &#8220;<span class="quote">up to date</span>&#8221; with the repository.</p></li>
</ul></div>

      working copy, read <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.html" title="Chapter 2. Basic Usage">Chapter 2, <i>Basic Usage</i></a>.</p>
<p>At this point, you have the option of making your repository
      available to others over a network.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.html" title="Chapter 6. Server Configuration">Chapter 6, <i>Server Configuration</i></a> to learn about the different sorts of
