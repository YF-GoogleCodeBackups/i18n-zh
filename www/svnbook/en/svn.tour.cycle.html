<p>Subversion has numerous features, options, bells, and
      whistles, but on a day-to-day basis, odds are that you will use
      only a few of them.  In this section, we'll run through the most
      common things that you might find yourself doing with Subversion
      in the course of a day's work.</p>
<p>The typical work cycle looks like this:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Update your working copy.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span></p></li></ul></div>

<a name="svn.tour.cycle.update"></a>2.4.1. Update Your Working Copy</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When working on a project with a team, you'll want to
        update your working copy to receive any changes other developers 
        on the project have made since your last update.  Use
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring your working copy into
        sync with the latest revision in the repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn update
U  foo.c
U  bar.c
Updated to revision 2.
</pre>
<p>In this case, it appears that someone checked in
        modifications to both <code class="filename">foo.c</code>
        and <code class="filename">bar.c</code> since the last time you
        updated, and Subversion has updated your working copy to
        include those changes.</p>
<p>When the server sends changes to your working copy via
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, a letter code is displayed next
        to each item to let you know what actions Subversion performed
        to bring your working copy up to date.  To find out what these
        letters mean, run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn help update</code></strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.edit"></a>2.4.2. Make Changes to Your Working Copy</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Now you can get to work and make changes in your working
        copy.  It's usually most convenient to decide on a discrete
        change (or set of changes) to make, such as writing a new
        feature, fixing a bug, and so on.  The Subversion commands that you
        will use here are <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        delete</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        move</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span>.  However, if
        you are merely editing files that are already in Subversion,
        you may not need to use any of these commands until you
        commit.</p>
<p>You can make two kinds of changes to your
        working copy: <em class="firstterm">file changes</em>
        and <em class="firstterm">tree changes</em>.  You don't need to
        tell Subversion that you intend to change a file; just make
        your changes using your text editor, word processor, graphics
        program, or whatever tool you would normally use.  Subversion
        automatically detects which files have been changed, and in
        addition, it handles binary files just as easily as it handles
        text files—and just as efficiently, too.  For tree
        changes, you can ask Subversion to “<span class="quote">mark</span>” files
        and directories for scheduled removal, addition, copying, or
        moving.  These changes may take place immediately in your
        working copy, but no additions or removals will happen in the
        repository until you commit them.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Versioning Symbolic Links</b></p>
<p>On non-Windows platforms, Subversion is able to version
          files of the special type <em class="firstterm">symbolic
          link</em> (or “<span class="quote">symlink</span>”).  A symlink is
          a file that acts as a sort of transparent reference to some
          other object in the filesystem, allowing programs to read
          and write to those objects indirectly by way of performing
          operations on the symlink itself.</p>
<p>When a symlink is committed into a Subversion
          repository, Subversion remembers that the file was in fact a
          symlink, as well as the object to which the symlink
          “<span class="quote">points.</span>”  When that symlink is checked out to
          another working copy on a non-Windows system, Subversion
          reconstructs a real filesystem-level symbolic link from the
          versioned symlink.  But that doesn't in any way limit the
          usability of working copies on systems such as Windows that
          do not support symlinks.  On such systems, Subversion simply
          creates a regular text file whose contents are the path to
          which to the original symlink pointed.  While that file
          can't be used as a symlink on a Windows system, it also
          won't prevent Windows users from performing their other
          Subversion-related activities.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is an overview of the five Subversion subcommands
        that you'll use most often to make tree changes:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn add foo</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <code class="filename">foo</code> to be added to the repository.
              When you next commit, <code class="filename">foo</code> will
              become a child of its parent directory.  Note that if
              <code class="filename">foo</code> is a directory, everything
              underneath <code class="filename">foo</code> will be scheduled
              for addition.  If you want only to add
              <code class="filename">foo</code> itself, pass the
              <code class="option">--depth empty</code> option.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn delete foo</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <code class="filename">foo</code> to be deleted from the
              repository.  If <code class="filename">foo</code> is a file or
              link, it is immediately deleted from your working copy.
              If <code class="filename">foo</code> is a directory, it is not
              deleted, but Subversion schedules it for deletion.  When
              you commit your changes, <code class="filename">foo</code> will
              be entirely removed from your working copy and the
              repository.
              <sup>[<a name="id411452" href="#ftn.id411452" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup>
            </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy foo bar</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>Create a new item <code class="filename">bar</code> as a
              duplicate of <code class="filename">foo</code> and automatically
              schedule <code class="filename">bar</code> for addition.  When
              <code class="filename">bar</code> is added to the repository on
              the next commit, its copy history is recorded (as having
              originally come from <code class="filename">foo</code>).
              <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> does not create intermediate
              directories unless you pass the
              <code class="option">--parents</code> option.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn move foo bar</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command is exactly the same as running
              <strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy foo bar; svn delete foo</code></strong>.
              That is, <code class="filename">bar</code> is scheduled for
              addition as a copy of <code class="filename">foo</code>, and
              <code class="filename">foo</code> is scheduled for removal.
              <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> does not create intermediate
              directories unless you pass the
              <code class="option">--parents</code> option.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn mkdir blort</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command is exactly the same as running
              <strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir blort; svn add blort</code></strong>.  That is,
              a new directory named <code class="filename">blort</code> is
              created and scheduled for addition.</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Changing the Repository Without a Working Copy</b></p>
<p>There <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> some use cases that
          immediately commit tree changes to the repository.  This
          happens only when a subcommand is operating directly on a
          URL, rather than on a working-copy path.  In particular,
          specific uses of <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>, and
          <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> can work with URLs (and don't
          forget that <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> always makes
          changes to a URL).</p>
<p>URL operations behave in this manner because commands
          that operate on a working copy can use the working copy as a
          sort of “<span class="quote">staging area</span>” to set up your changes
          before committing them to the repository.  Commands that
          operate on URLs don't have this luxury, so when you operate
          directly on a URL, any of the aforementioned actions represents an
          immediate commit.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.examine"></a>2.4.3. Examine Your Changes</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit
        them to the repository, but before you do so, it's usually a
        good idea to take a look at exactly what you've changed.  By
        examining your changes before you commit, you can make a more
        accurate log message.  You may also discover that you've
        inadvertently changed a file, and this gives you a chance to
        revert those changes before committing.  Additionally, this is
        a good opportunity to review and scrutinize changes before
        publishing them.  You can see an overview of the changes
        you've made by using <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>, and dig
        into the details of those changes by using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff</strong></span>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Look Ma! No Network!</b></p>
<p>You can use the commands <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>,
          <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          revert</strong></span> without any network access even
          if your repository <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> across the
          network.  This makes it easy to manage your
          changes-in-progress when you are somewhere without a network
          connection, such as traveling on an airplane, riding a
          commuter train, or hacking on the beach.
          <sup>[<a name="id411713" href="#ftn.id411713" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup>
        </p>
<p>Subversion does this by keeping private caches of
          pristine versions of each versioned file inside the
          <code class="filename">.svn</code> administrative areas.  This allows
          Subversion to report—and revert—local
          modifications to those files <span class="emphasis"><em>without network
          access</em></span>.  This cache (called the
          “<span class="quote">text-base</span>”) also allows Subversion to send the
          user's local modifications during a commit to the server as
          a compressed <em class="firstterm">delta</em> (or
          “<span class="quote">difference</span>”) against the pristine version.
          Having this cache is a tremendous benefit—even if you
          have a fast Internet connection, it's much faster to send only a
          file's changes rather than the whole file to the
          server.</p>
</div>
<p>Subversion has been optimized to help you with this task,
        and it is able to do many things without communicating with
        the repository.  In particular, your working copy contains a
        hidden cached “<span class="quote">pristine</span>” copy of each version-controlled
        file within the <code class="filename">.svn</code> area.
        Because of this, Subversion can quickly show you how your
        working files have changed or even allow you to undo your
        changes without contacting the repository.</p>
<div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.examine.status"></a>2.4.3.1. See an overview of your changes</h4></div></div></div>
<p>To get an overview of your changes, you'll use the
          <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> command.  You'll probably use
          <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> more than any other Subversion
          command.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>CVS Users: Hold That Update!</b></p>
<p>You're probably used to using <span class="command"><strong>cvs
            update</strong></span> to see what changes you've made to your
            working copy.  <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> will give you
            all the information you need regarding what has changed in
            your working copy—without accessing the repository
            or potentially incorporating new changes published by
            other users.</p>
<p>In Subversion, <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> does just
            that—it updates your working copy with any changes
            committed to the repository since the last time you
            updated your working copy.  You may have to break the
            habit of using the <span class="command"><strong>update</strong></span> command to
            see what local modifications you've made.</p>
</div>
<p>If you run <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> at the top of
          your working copy with no arguments, it will detect all file
          and tree changes you've made.  Here are a few examples of
          the most common status codes that <span class="command"><strong>svn
          status</strong></span> can return.  (Note that the text following
          <code class="literal">#</code> is not
          actually printed by <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.)</p>
<pre class="screen">
?       scratch.c           # file is not under version control
A       stuff/loot/bloo.h   # file is scheduled for addition
C       stuff/loot/lump.c   # file has textual conflicts from an update
D       stuff/fish.c        # file is scheduled for deletion
M       bar.c               # the content in bar.c has local modifications
</pre>
<p>In this output format, <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>
          prints six columns of characters, followed by several
          whitespace characters, followed by a file or directory name.
          The first column tells the status of a file or directory
          and/or its contents.  The codes we listed are:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">A      item</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The file, directory, or symbolic link
                <code class="filename">item</code> has been scheduled for
                addition into the repository.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">C      item</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The file <code class="filename">item</code> is in a state
                of conflict.  That is, changes received from the
                server during an update overlap with local changes
                that you have in your working copy (and weren't
                resolved during the update).  You must resolve this
                conflict before committing your changes to the
                repository.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">D      item</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The file, directory, or symbolic link
                <code class="filename">item</code> has been scheduled for

<dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">M      item</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The contents of the file <code class="filename">item</code>

<p>If you pass a specific path to <span class="command"><strong>svn

          alone:</p>
<pre class="screen">

<p><span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> also has a

          <code class="option">--show-updates</code> (<code class="option">-u</code>)
          option, which contacts the repository and adds information
          about things that are out of date:</p>

<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> command produces this
          output by comparing your working files against the cached
          “<span class="quote">pristine</span>” copies within the
          <code class="filename">.svn</code> area.  Files scheduled for
          addition are displayed as all added text, and files
          scheduled for deletion are displayed as all deleted
          text.</p>
<p>Output is displayed in unified diff format.  That is,
          removed lines are prefaced with <code class="literal">-</code>, and
          added lines are prefaced with
          <code class="literal">+</code>.  <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> also
          prints filename and offset information useful to the
          <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program, so you can generate
          “<span class="quote">patches</span>” by redirecting the diff output to a
          file:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn diff &gt; patchfile

<p>You could, for example, email the patch file to another
          developer for review or testing prior to a commit.</p>
<p>Subversion uses its internal diff engine, which produces
          unified diff format, by default.  If you want diff output in
          a different format, specify an external diff program using
          <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and pass any flags you'd like to
          it using the <code class="option">--extensions</code>
          (<code class="option">-x</code>) option.  For example, to see local
          differences in file <code class="filename">foo.c</code> in context
          output format while ignoring case differences, you might run
          <strong class="userinput"><code>svn diff --diff-cmd /usr/bin/diff --extensions '-i'

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.resolve.resolve"></a>2.4.5.2. Resolving conflict differences interactively</h4></div></div></div>
<p>There are four different ways to resolve conflicts
          interactively—two of which allow you to selectively
          merge and edit changes, and two of which allow you to simply
          pick a version of the file and move along.</p>
<p>If you wish to choose some combination of your local
          changes, you can use the “<span class="quote">edit</span>” command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>e</code></strong>) to manually edit the file with
          conflict markers in a text editor (determined by the
          <code class="literal">EDITOR</code> environment variable).  Editing
          the file by hand in your favorite text editor is a somewhat
          low-tech way of remedying conflicts (see <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve.byhand" title="2.4.5.4. Merging conflicts by hand">Section 2.4.5.4, “Merging conflicts by hand”</a> for a
          walkthrough), so some people like to use fancy graphical
          merge tools instead.</p>
<p>To use a merge tool, you need to either set the
          <code class="literal">SVN_MERGE</code> environment variable or define
          the <code class="literal">merge-tool-cmd</code> option in your
          Subversion configuration file (see <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts" title="7.1.3. Configuration Options">Section 7.1.3, “Configuration Options”</a> for more details).
          Subversion will pass four arguments to the merge tool: the
          <code class="literal">BASE</code> revision of the file, the revision
          of the file received from the server as part of the update,
          the copy of the file containing your local edits, and
          the merged copy of the file (which contains conflict
          markers).  If your merge tool is expecting arguments in a
          different order or format, you'll need to write a wrapper
          script for Subversion to invoke.  After you've edited the
          file, if you're satisfied with the changes you've made, you
          can tell Subversion that the edited file is no longer in
          conflict by using the “<span class="quote">resolve</span>” command
          (<code class="literal">r</code>).</p>
<p>If you decide that you don't need to merge any changes,
          but just want to accept one version of the file or the
          other, you can either choose your changes (a.k.a.
          “<span class="quote">mine</span>”) by using the “<span class="quote">mine-full</span>”
          command (<strong class="userinput"><code>mf</code></strong>) or choose theirs by using the
          “<span class="quote">theirs-full</span>” command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>tf</code></strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.resolve.pending"></a>2.4.5.3. Postponing conflict resolution</h4></div></div></div>
<p>This may sound like an appropriate section for avoiding
          marital disagreements, but it's actually still about
          Subversion, so read on.  If you're doing an update and
          encounter a conflict that you're not prepared to review or
          resolve, you can type <strong class="userinput"><code>p</code></strong> to postpone
          resolving a conflict on a file-by-file basis when you run
          <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong>.  If you're running an update
          and don't want to resolve any conflicts, you can pass the
          <code class="option">--non-interactive</code> option to <span class="command"><strong>svn
          update</strong></span>, and any file in conflict will be marked
          with a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
          automatically.</p>
<p>The <code class="computeroutput">C</code> stands for
          <code class="computeroutput">c</code>onflict.  This means that
          the changes from the server overlapped with your own, and
          now you have to manually choose between them after the
          update has completed.  When you postpone a conflict
          resolution, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> typically does three
          things to assist you in noticing and resolving that
          conflict:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Subversion prints a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
              during the update and remembers that the file is in a
              state of conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>If Subversion considers the file to be mergeable, it
              places <em class="firstterm">conflict
              markers</em>—special strings of text that
              delimit the “<span class="quote">sides</span>” of the
              conflict—into the file to visibly demonstrate the
              overlapping areas.  (Subversion uses the
              <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to decide whether a
              file is capable of contextual, line-based merging.  See
              <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. File Content Type">Section 3.3.1, “File Content Type”</a>
              to learn more.)</p></li>
<li>
<p>For every conflicted file, Subversion places three
              extra unversioned files in your working copy:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">filename.mine</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is your file as it existed in your working
                    copy before you updated your working copy—that
                    is, without conflict markers.  This file has only
                    your latest changes in it.  (If Subversion considers
                    the file to be unmergeable, the
                    <code class="filename">.mine</code> file isn't created, since
                    it would be identical to the working file.)</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">filename.r<em class="replaceable"><code>OLDREV</code></em>
                      </code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the file that was the
                    <code class="literal">BASE</code> revision before you updated
                    your working copy.  That is, the file that you
                    checked out before you made your latest
                    edits.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">filename.r<em class="replaceable"><code>NEWREV</code></em>
                      </code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the file that your Subversion client
                    just received from the server when you updated your
                    working copy.  This file corresponds to the
                    <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision of the
                    repository.</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>Here <em class="replaceable"><code>OLDREV</code></em> is the revision number
              of the file in your <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory,
              and <em class="replaceable"><code>NEWREV</code></em> is the revision number of
              the repository <code class="literal">HEAD</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>For example, Sally makes changes to the file
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code>, but does not yet commit
          those changes.  Meanwhile, Harry commits changes to that
          same file.  Sally updates her working copy before committing
          and she gets a conflict, which she postpones:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn update
Conflict discovered in 'sandwich.txt'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h)elp for more options : p
C  sandwich.txt
Updated to revision 2.
$ ls -1
sandwich.txt
sandwich.txt.mine
sandwich.txt.r1
sandwich.txt.r2
</pre>
<p>At this point, Subversion will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
          allow Sally to commit the file
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> until the three temporary
          files are removed:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Add a few more things"
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Aborting commit: '/home/sally/svn-work/sandwich.txt' remains in conflict
</pre>
<p>If you've postponed a conflict, you need to resolve the
          conflict before Subversion will allow you to commit your
          changes.  You'll do this with the <span class="command"><strong>svn
          resolve</strong></span> command and one of several arguments to
          the <code class="option">--accept</code> option.</p>
<p>If you want to choose the version of the file that you
          last checked out before making your edits, choose
          the <em class="replaceable"><code>base</code></em> argument.</p>
<p>If you want to choose the version that contains only
          your edits, choose the <em class="replaceable"><code>mine-full</code></em>
          argument.</p>
<p>If you want to choose the version that your most recent
          update pulled from the server (and thus discarding your
          edits entirely), choose
          the <em class="replaceable"><code>theirs-full</code></em> argument.</p>
<p>However, if you want to pick and choose from your
          changes and the changes that your update fetched from the
          server, merge the conflicted text “<span class="quote">by hand</span>” (by
          examining and editing the conflict markers within the file)

          argument.</p>
<p><span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span> removes the three
          temporary files and accepts the version of the file that you
          specified with the <code class="option">--accept</code> option, and
          Subversion no longer considers the file to be in a state of
          conflict:</p>

<a name="svn.tour.cycle.resolve.byhand"></a>2.4.5.4. Merging conflicts by hand</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Merging conflicts by hand can be quite intimidating the
          first time you attempt it, but with a little practice, it
          can become as easy as falling off a bike.</p>
<p>Here's an example.  Due to a miscommunication, you and
          Sally, your collaborator, both edit the file
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> at the same time.  Sally
          commits her changes, and when you go to update your working
          copy, you get a conflict and you're going to have to edit
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> to resolve the conflict.
          First, let's take a look at the file:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ cat sandwich.txt
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
Creole Mustard
Bottom piece of bread
</pre>
<p>The strings of less-than signs, equals signs, and
          greater-than signs are conflict markers and are not part of
          the actual data in conflict.  You generally want to ensure
          that those are removed from the file before your next
          commit.  The text between the first two sets of markers is
          composed of the changes you made in the conflicting
          area:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======
</pre>
<p>The text between the second and third sets of conflict
          markers is the text from Sally's commit:</p>
<pre class="screen">
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
</pre>
<p>Usually you won't want to just delete the conflict
          markers and Sally's changes—she's going to be awfully
          surprised when the sandwich arrives and it's not what she
          wanted.  This is where you pick up the phone or walk
          across the office and explain to Sally that you can't get
          sauerkraut from an Italian deli.
          <sup>[<a name="id413216" href="#ftn.id413216" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>
          Once you've agreed on the changes you will commit, edit
          your file and remove the conflict markers:</p>
<pre class="screen">
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
Creole Mustard
Bottom piece of bread
</pre>
<p>Now use <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, and you're
          ready to commit your changes:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn resolve --accept working sandwich.txt
Resolved conflicted state of 'sandwich.txt'
$ svn commit -m "Go ahead and use my sandwich, discarding Sally's edits."
</pre>
<p>Note that <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, unlike most of
          the other commands we deal with in this chapter, requires
          that you explicitly list any filenames that you wish to
          resolve.  In any case, you want to be careful and use
          <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span> only when you're certain that
          you've fixed the conflict in your file—once the
          temporary files are removed, Subversion will let you commit
          the file even if it still contains conflict markers.</p>
<p>If you ever get confused while editing the conflicted
          file, you can always consult the three files that Subversion
          creates for you in your working copy—including your
          file as it was before you updated.  You can even use a
          third-party interactive merging tool to examine those three
          files.</p>

<p>If you get a conflict and decide that you want to throw
          out your changes, you can run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn resolve --accept
          theirs-full <em class="replaceable"><code>CONFLICTED-PATH</code></em></code></strong> and Subversion will discard your edits
          and remove the temporary files:</p>

<p>If you decide that you want to throw out your changes
          and start your edits again (whether this occurs after a
          conflict or anytime), just revert your changes:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn revert sandwich.txt
Reverted 'sandwich.txt'
$ ls sandwich.*

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">

<p>Finally!  Your edits are finished, you've merged all
        changes from the server, and you're ready to commit your
        changes to the repository.</p>
<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command sends all of
        your changes to the repository.  When you commit a change, you
        need to supply a <em class="firstterm">log message</em>
        describing your change.  Your log message will be attached to
        the new revision you create.  If your log message is brief,
        you may wish to supply it on the command line using the
        <code class="option">--message</code> (or <code class="option">-m</code>)
        option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Corrected number of cheese slices."
Sending        sandwich.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 3.
</pre>
<p>However, if you've been composing your log message as you
        work, you may want to tell Subversion to get the message from
        a file by passing the filename with the
        <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -F logmsg
Sending        sandwich.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 4.
</pre>
<p>If you fail to specify either the
        <code class="option">--message</code> or <code class="option">--file</code> option,
        Subversion will automatically launch your favorite editor
        (see the information on <code class="literal">editor-cmd</code> in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="7.1.3.2. Config">Section 7.1.3.2, “Config”</a>) for composing a log

<p>If you're in your editor writing a commit message and
          decide that you want to cancel your commit, you can just
          quit your editor without saving changes.  If you've already
          saved your commit message, simply delete the text, save
          again, and then abort:</p>

<p>The repository doesn't know or care whether your changes make
        any sense as a whole; it checks only to make sure nobody
        else has changed any of the same files that you did when you
        weren't looking.  If somebody <span class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> done
        that, the entire commit will fail with a message informing you
        that one or more of your files are out of date:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Add another rule"
Sending        rules.txt
svn: Commit failed (details follow):

</pre>
<p>(The exact wording of this error message depends on the
        network protocol and server you're using, but the idea is the
        same in all cases.)</p>
<p>At this point, you need to run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        update</code></strong>, deal with any merges or conflicts that
        result, and attempt your commit again.</p>
<p>That covers the basic work cycle for using Subversion.
        Subversion offers many other features that you can use
        to manage your repository and working copy, but most of your
        day-to-day use of Subversion will involve only the commands
        that we've discussed so far in this chapter.  We will,
        however, cover a few more commands that you'll use fairly
        often.</p>
