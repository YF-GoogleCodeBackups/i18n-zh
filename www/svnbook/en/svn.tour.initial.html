<p>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
      repository by doing a <em class="firstterm">checkout</em> of your
      project.  Checking out a repository creates a “<span class="quote">working
      copy</span>” of it on your local machine.  This copy contains
      the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> (latest revision) of the Subversion
      repository that you specify on the command line:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk
A    trunk/Makefile.in
A    trunk/ac-helpers
A    trunk/ac-helpers/install.sh

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>What's in a Name?</b></p>
<p>Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you
        can place under version control.  The contents of files and
        property values are stored and transmitted as binary data, and
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. File Content Type">Section 3.3.1, “File Content Type”</a>
        tells you how to give Subversion a hint that
        “<span class="quote">textual</span>” operations don't make sense for a
        particular file.  There are a few places, however, where
        Subversion places restrictions on information it
        stores.</p>
<p>Subversion internally handles certain bits of
        data—for example, property names, pathnames, and log
        messages—as UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  This is not to say
        that all your interactions with Subversion must involve UTF-8,
        though.  As a general rule, Subversion clients will gracefully
        and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
        encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion
        can meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common
        encodings in use today).</p>
<p>In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of
        Subversion's administrative files, paths are used as XML
        attribute values, and property names in XML tag names.  This
        means that pathnames can contain only legal XML (1.0)
        characters, and properties are further limited to ASCII
        characters.  Subversion also prohibits <code class="literal">TAB</code>,
        <code class="literal">CR</code>, and <code class="literal">LF</code> characters in
        path names to prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or
        in the output of commands such as <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>
        or <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice
        these limitations are rarely a problem.  As long as your
        locale settings are compatible with UTF-8 and you don't use
        control characters in path names, you should have no trouble
        communicating with Subversion.  The command-line client adds
        an extra bit of help—to create
        “<span class="quote">legally correct</span>” versions for internal
        use it will automatically escape illegal
        path characters as needed in URLs that you type.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk directory,
      you can just as easily check out any deep subdirectory of a
      repository by specifying the subdirectory in the checkout
      URL:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout \
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/tests/cmdline/
A    cmdline/revert_tests.py
A    cmdline/diff_tests.py
A    cmdline/autoprop_tests.py
A    cmdline/xmltests
A    cmdline/xmltests/svn-test.sh
…

</pre>
<p>Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge
      model instead of lock-modify-unlock (see
      <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.vsn-models.html" title="1.2. Versioning Models">Section 1.2, “Versioning Models”</a>), you can immediately
      make changes to the files and directories in your working
      copy.  Your working copy is just like any other collection of
      files and directories on your system.  You can edit and change
      it, move it around, even delete the entire working copy and
      forget about it.</p>
<div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></td>
<th align="left">Warning</th>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While your working copy is “<span class="quote">just like any other
          collection of files and directories on your system,</span>”
          you can edit files at will, but you must tell Subversion
          about <span class="emphasis"><em>everything else</em></span> that you do.  For
          example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working
          copy, you should use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> instead of the copy and move
          commands provided by your operating system.  We'll talk more
          about them later in this chapter.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Unless you're ready to commit the addition of a new file or
      directory or changes to existing ones, there's no need to
      further notify the Subversion server that you've done
      anything.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>What's with the .svn Directory?</b></p>
<p>Every directory in a working copy contains an
        administrative area—a subdirectory named
        <code class="filename">.svn</code>.  Usually, directory listing
        commands won't show this subdirectory, but it is nevertheless
        an important directory.  Whatever you do, don't delete or
        change anything in the administrative area!  Subversion
        depends on it to manage your working copy.</p>
<p>If you accidentally remove the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
        subdirectory, the easiest way to fix the problem is to remove
        the entire containing directory (a normal system deletion,
        not <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span>), then run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        update</code></strong> from a parent directory.  The Subversion
        client will download the directory you've deleted, with a
        new <code class="filename">.svn</code> area as well.</p>
</div>
<p>While you can certainly check out a working copy with the
      URL of the repository as the only argument, you can also specify
      a directory after your repository URL.  This places your working
      copy in the new directory that you name.  For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$  svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
A    subv/Makefile.in
A    subv/ac-helpers
A    subv/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    subv/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    subv/build.conf
…
Checked out revision 8810.
</pre>
<p>That will place your working copy in a directory named
      <code class="literal">subv</code> instead of a directory named
      <code class="literal">trunk</code> as we did previously.  The directory
      <code class="literal">subv</code> will be created if it doesn't already
      exist.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.initial.disabling-password-caching"></a>2.3.1. Disabling Password Caching</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When you perform a Subversion operation that requires you
        to authenticate, by default Subversion tries to cache your
        authentication credentials on disk in encrypted form.
        On some systems, Subversion may be unable to encrypt your
        authentication data. You will then be asked whether you
        want to cache your credentials to disk in plaintext.
        You can choose to do so for convenience so that you don't have
        to continually reenter your password for future operations.
        If you're concerned about caching your Subversion passwords
        in plaintext and do not want to be asked about it again and
        again, you can disable caching of plaintext passwords either
        permanently, or on a server-per-server basis.</p>
<p>To permanently disable caching of passwords in plaintext,
        you can add the line
        <code class="literal">store-plaintext-passwords = no</code>
        to the global section in the <code class="filename">servers</code>
        configuration file on the local machine.  To disable caching
        of plaintext passwords for a particular server, use the same
        setting in the appropriate group section in the
        <code class="filename">servers</code> configuration file.
        See <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts" title="7.1.3. Configuration Options">Section 7.1.3, “Configuration Options”</a>
        in <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html" title="Chapter 7. Customizing Your Subversion Experience">Chapter 7, <i>Customizing Your Subversion Experience</i></a> for details.</p>
<p>You can also disable caching of authentication credentials
        entirely, regardless of whether the credentials are stored
        in encrypted form or not.</p>
<p>To disable password caching entirely for a particular one-time
        command, pass the <code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code> option on
        the command line.  To permanently disable caching entirely,
        you can add the line <code class="literal">store-passwords = no</code>
        to your local machine's Subversion configuration file.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="3.11.2. Client Credentials Caching">Section 3.11.2, “Client Credentials Caching”</a> for
        details.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.initial.different-user"></a>2.3.2. Authenticating As a Different User</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Since Subversion caches auth credentials by default (both
        username and password), it conveniently remembers who you were
        acting as the last time you modified your working copy.  But
        sometimes that's not helpful—particularly if you're
        working in a shared working copy such as a system
        configuration directory or a web server document root.  In this
        case, just pass the <code class="option">--username</code> option on the
        command line, and Subversion will attempt to authenticate as
        that user, prompting you for a password if necessary.</p>
