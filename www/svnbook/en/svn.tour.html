<p>Now we will go into the details of using Subversion.  By the
    time you reach the end of this chapter, you will be able to
    perform all the tasks you need to use Subversion in a normal day's
    work.  You'll start with getting your files into Subversion,
    followed by an initial checkout of your code.  We'll then walk you
    through making changes and examining those changes.  You'll also
    see how to bring changes made by others into your working copy,
    examine them, and work through any conflicts that might
    arise.</p>
<p>Note that this chapter is not meant to be an exhaustive list
    of all of Subversion's commands&#8212;rather, it's a conversational
    introduction to the most common Subversion tasks that you'll
    encounter.  This chapter assumes that you've read and understood
    <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.html" title="Chapter 1. Fundamental Concepts">Chapter 1, <i>Fundamental Concepts</i></a> and are familiar with the general
    model of Subversion.  For a complete reference of all commands,
    see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.html" title="Chapter 9. Subversion Complete Reference">Chapter 9, <i>Subversion Complete Reference</i></a>.</p>

<a name="svn.tour.help"></a>2.1. Help!</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Before reading on, here is the most important command you'll
      ever need when using Subversion: <span class="command"><strong>svn help</strong></span>.
      The Subversion command-line client is self-documenting&#8212;at
      any time, a quick <strong class="userinput"><code>svn help
      <em class="replaceable"><code>subcommand</code></em></code></strong> will describe
      the syntax, options, and behavior of the subcommand.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn help import
import: Commit an unversioned file or tree into the repository.
usage: import [PATH] URL

  Recursively commit a copy of PATH to URL.
  If PATH is omitted '.' is assumed.
  Parent directories are created as necessary in the repository.
  If PATH is a directory, the contents of the directory are added
  directly under URL.
  Unversionable items such as device files and pipes are ignored
  if --force is specified.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
&#8230;
</pre>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Options and Switches and Flags, Oh My!</b></p>
<p>The Subversion command-line client has numerous command
          modifiers (which we call options), but there are two
          distinct kinds of options:  short options
          are a single hyphen followed by a single letter, and
          long options consist of two hyphens
          followed by a number of letters (e.g., <code class="literal">-s</code>
          and <code class="literal">--this-is-a-long-option</code>,
          respectively).  Every option has a long format, but only
          certain options have an additional short format (these are
          typically options that are frequently used).  To
          maintain clarity, we <span class="emphasis"><em>usually</em></span> use the
          long form in code examples, but when describing options, if
          there's a short form, we'll provide the long form (to
          improve clarity) and the short form (to make it easier to
          remember).  You should use whichever one you're more
          comfortable with, but don't try to use both.</p>

<a name="svn.tour.importing"></a>2.2. Getting Data into Your Repository</h2></div></div></div>
<p>You can get new files into your Subversion
      repository in two ways: <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      add</strong></span>.  We'll discuss <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> now
      and will discuss <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> later in this
      chapter when we review a typical day with Subversion.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.importing.import"></a>2.2.1. svn import</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> command is a quick way to
        copy an unversioned tree of files into a repository, creating
        intermediate directories as necessary.  <span class="command"><strong>svn
        import</strong></span> doesn't require a working copy, and your files
        are immediately committed to the repository.  You typically
        use this when you have an existing tree of files that you want to
        begin tracking in your Subversion repository.  For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/newrepos
$ svn import mytree file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project \
             -m "Initial import"
Adding         mytree/foo.c
Adding         mytree/bar.c
Adding         mytree/subdir
Adding         mytree/subdir/quux.h

Committed revision 1.
</pre>
<p>The previous example copied the contents of directory
        <code class="filename">mytree</code> under the directory
        <code class="filename">some/project</code> in the repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn list file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project
bar.c
foo.c
subdir/
</pre>
<p>Note that after the import is finished, the original tree
        is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> converted into a working copy.  To
        start working, you still need to <span class="command"><strong>svn
        checkout</strong></span> a fresh working copy of the tree.</p>

<a name="svn.tour.importing.layout"></a>2.2.2. Recommended Repository Layout</h3></div></div></div>
<p>While Subversion's flexibility allows you to lay out your
      repository in any way that you choose, we recommend that you
      create a <code class="filename">trunk</code> directory to hold the
      &#8220;<span class="quote">main line</span>&#8221; of development, a
      <code class="filename">branches</code> directory to contain branch
      copies, and a <code class="filename">tags</code> directory to contain tag
      copies.  For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn list file:///var/svn/repos
/trunk
/branches
/tags
</pre>
<p>You'll learn more about tags and branches in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.html" title="Chapter 4. Branching and Merging">Chapter 4, <i>Branching and Merging</i></a>.  For details and how to set up
      multiple projects, see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.html#svn.branchmerge.maint.layout" title="4.7.1. Repository Layout">Section 4.7.1, &#8220;Repository Layout&#8221;</a> and <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="5.2.1. Planning Your Repository Organization">Section 5.2.1, &#8220;Planning Your Repository Organization&#8221;</a> to read more

<p>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
      repository by doing a <em class="firstterm">checkout</em> of your
      project.  Checking out a repository creates a &#8220;<span class="quote">working
      copy</span>&#8221; of it on your local machine.  This copy contains
      the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> (latest revision) of the Subversion
      repository that you specify on the command line:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk

&#8230;
Checked out revision 8810.
</pre>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>What's in a Name?</b></p>
<p>Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you
        can place under version control.  The contents of files and
        property values are stored and transmitted as binary data, and
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. File Content Type">Section 3.3.1, &#8220;File Content Type&#8221;</a>
        tells you how to give Subversion a hint that
        &#8220;<span class="quote">textual</span>&#8221; operations don't make sense for a
        particular file.  There are a few places, however, where
        Subversion places restrictions on information it
        stores.</p>
<p>Subversion internally handles certain bits of
        data&#8212;for example, property names, pathnames, and log
        messages&#8212;as UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  This is not to say
        that all your interactions with Subversion must involve UTF-8,
        though.  As a general rule, Subversion clients will gracefully
        and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
        encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion
        can meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common
        encodings in use today).</p>
<p>In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of
        Subversion's administrative files, paths are used as XML
        attribute values, and property names in XML tag names.  This
        means that pathnames can contain only legal XML (1.0)
        characters, and properties are further limited to ASCII
        characters.  Subversion also prohibits <code class="literal">TAB</code>,
        <code class="literal">CR</code>, and <code class="literal">LF</code> characters in
        path names to prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or
        in the output of commands such as <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>
        or <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice
        these limitations are rarely a problem.  As long as your
        locale settings are compatible with UTF-8 and you don't use
        control characters in path names, you should have no trouble
        communicating with Subversion.  The command-line client adds
        an extra bit of help&#8212;to create
        &#8220;<span class="quote">legally correct</span>&#8221; versions for internal
        use it will automatically escape illegal
        path characters as needed in URLs that you type.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk directory,
      you can just as easily check out any deep subdirectory of a
      repository by specifying the subdirectory in the checkout
      URL:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout \
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/tests/cmdline/
A    cmdline/revert_tests.py
A    cmdline/diff_tests.py
A    cmdline/autoprop_tests.py

</pre>
<p>Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge
      model instead of lock-modify-unlock (see
      <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.html#svn.basic.vsn-models" title="1.2. Versioning Models">Section 1.2, &#8220;Versioning Models&#8221;</a>), you can immediately
      make changes to the files and directories in your working
      copy.  Your working copy is just like any other collection of
      files and directories on your system.  You can edit and change
      it, move it around, even delete the entire working copy and
      forget about it.</p>
<div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning">

          collection of files and directories on your system,</span>&#8221;
          you can edit files at will, but you must tell Subversion
          about <span class="emphasis"><em>everything else</em></span> that you do.  For
          example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working
          copy, you should use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> instead of the copy and move
          commands provided by your operating system.  We'll talk more
          about them later in this chapter.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Unless you're ready to commit the addition of a new file or
      directory or changes to existing ones, there's no need to
      further notify the Subversion server that you've done
      anything.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>What's with the .svn Directory?</b></p>
<p>Every directory in a working copy contains an
        administrative area&#8212;a subdirectory named
        <code class="filename">.svn</code>.  Usually, directory listing
        commands won't show this subdirectory, but it is nevertheless
        an important directory.  Whatever you do, don't delete or
        change anything in the administrative area!  Subversion
        depends on it to manage your working copy.</p>
<p>If you accidentally remove the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
        subdirectory, the easiest way to fix the problem is to remove
        the entire containing directory (a normal system deletion,
        not <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span>), then run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        update</code></strong> from a parent directory.  The Subversion
        client will download the directory you've deleted, with a
        new <code class="filename">.svn</code> area as well.</p>
</div>
<p>While you can certainly check out a working copy with the
      URL of the repository as the only argument, you can also specify
      a directory after your repository URL.  This places your working
      copy in the new directory that you name.  For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$  svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
A    subv/Makefile.in
A    subv/ac-helpers
A    subv/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    subv/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    subv/build.conf
&#8230;
Checked out revision 8810.
</pre>
<p>That will place your working copy in a directory named
      <code class="literal">subv</code> instead of a directory named
      <code class="literal">trunk</code> as we did previously.  The directory
      <code class="literal">subv</code> will be created if it doesn't already
      exist.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.initial.disabling-password-caching"></a>2.3.1. Disabling Password Caching</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When you perform a Subversion operation that requires you
        to authenticate, by default Subversion tries to cache your
        authentication credentials on disk in encrypted form.
        On some systems, Subversion may be unable to encrypt your
        authentication data. You will then be asked whether you
        want to cache your credentials to disk in plaintext.
        You can choose to do so for convenience so that you don't have
        to continually reenter your password for future operations.
        If you're concerned about caching your Subversion passwords
        in plaintext and do not want to be asked about it again and
        again, you can disable caching of plaintext passwords either
        permanently, or on a server-per-server basis.</p>
<p>To permanently disable caching of passwords in plaintext,
        you can add the line
        <code class="literal">store-plaintext-passwords = no</code>
        to the global section in the <code class="filename">servers</code>
        configuration file on the local machine.  To disable caching
        of plaintext passwords for a particular server, use the same
        setting in the appropriate group section in the
        <code class="filename">servers</code> configuration file.
        See <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts" title="7.1.3. Configuration Options">Section 7.1.3, &#8220;Configuration Options&#8221;</a>
        in <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html" title="Chapter 7. Customizing Your Subversion Experience">Chapter 7, <i>Customizing Your Subversion Experience</i></a> for details.</p>
<p>You can also disable caching of authentication credentials
        entirely, regardless of whether the credentials are stored
        in encrypted form or not.</p>
<p>To disable password caching entirely for a particular one-time
        command, pass the <code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code> option on
        the command line.  To permanently disable caching entirely,
        you can add the line <code class="literal">store-passwords = no</code>
        to your local machine's Subversion configuration file.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="3.11.2. Client Credentials Caching">Section 3.11.2, &#8220;Client Credentials Caching&#8221;</a> for

<a name="svn.tour.initial.different-user"></a>2.3.2. Authenticating As a Different User</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Since Subversion caches auth credentials by default (both
        username and password), it conveniently remembers who you were
        acting as the last time you modified your working copy.  But
        sometimes that's not helpful&#8212;particularly if you're
        working in a shared working copy such as a system
        configuration directory or a web server document root.  In this
        case, just pass the <code class="option">--username</code> option on the
        command line, and Subversion will attempt to authenticate as
        that user, prompting you for a password if necessary.</p>

      only a few of them.  In this section, we'll run through the most

<a name="svn.tour.cycle.update"></a>2.4.1. Update Your Working Copy</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When working on a project with a team, you'll want to
        update your working copy to receive any changes other developers 
        on the project have made since your last update.  Use
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring your working copy into
        sync with the latest revision in the repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn update
U  foo.c
U  bar.c
Updated to revision 2.
</pre>
<p>In this case, it appears that someone checked in
        modifications to both <code class="filename">foo.c</code>
        and <code class="filename">bar.c</code> since the last time you
        updated, and Subversion has updated your working copy to
        include those changes.</p>
<p>When the server sends changes to your working copy via
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, a letter code is displayed next
        to each item to let you know what actions Subversion performed
        to bring your working copy up to date.  To find out what these
        letters mean, run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn help update</code></strong>.</p>
</div>

<a name="svn.tour.cycle.edit"></a>2.4.2. Make Changes to Your Working Copy</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Now you can get to work and make changes in your working
        copy.  It's usually most convenient to decide on a discrete
        change (or set of changes) to make, such as writing a new
        feature, fixing a bug, and so on.  The Subversion commands that you
        will use here are <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        delete</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        move</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span>.  However, if
        you are merely editing files that are already in Subversion,
        you may not need to use any of these commands until you
        commit.</p>
<p>You can make two kinds of changes to your
        working copy: <em class="firstterm">file changes</em>
        and <em class="firstterm">tree changes</em>.  You don't need to
        tell Subversion that you intend to change a file; just make
        your changes using your text editor, word processor, graphics
        program, or whatever tool you would normally use.  Subversion
        automatically detects which files have been changed, and in
        addition, it handles binary files just as easily as it handles
        text files&#8212;and just as efficiently, too.  For tree
        changes, you can ask Subversion to &#8220;<span class="quote">mark</span>&#8221; files
        and directories for scheduled removal, addition, copying, or
        moving.  These changes may take place immediately in your
        working copy, but no additions or removals will happen in the
        repository until you commit them.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Versioning Symbolic Links</b></p>
<p>On non-Windows platforms, Subversion is able to version
          files of the special type <em class="firstterm">symbolic
          link</em> (or &#8220;<span class="quote">symlink</span>&#8221;).  A symlink is
          a file that acts as a sort of transparent reference to some
          other object in the filesystem, allowing programs to read
          and write to those objects indirectly by way of performing
          operations on the symlink itself.</p>
<p>When a symlink is committed into a Subversion
          repository, Subversion remembers that the file was in fact a
          symlink, as well as the object to which the symlink
          &#8220;<span class="quote">points.</span>&#8221;  When that symlink is checked out to
          another working copy on a non-Windows system, Subversion
          reconstructs a real filesystem-level symbolic link from the
          versioned symlink.  But that doesn't in any way limit the
          usability of working copies on systems such as Windows that
          do not support symlinks.  On such systems, Subversion simply
          creates a regular text file whose contents are the path to
          which to the original symlink pointed.  While that file
          can't be used as a symlink on a Windows system, it also
          won't prevent Windows users from performing their other
          Subversion-related activities.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is an overview of the five Subversion subcommands
        that you'll use most often to make tree changes:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn add foo</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <code class="filename">foo</code> to be added to the repository.
              When you next commit, <code class="filename">foo</code> will
              become a child of its parent directory.  Note that if
              <code class="filename">foo</code> is a directory, everything
              underneath <code class="filename">foo</code> will be scheduled
              for addition.  If you want only to add
              <code class="filename">foo</code> itself, pass the
              <code class="option">--depth empty</code> option.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn delete foo</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <code class="filename">foo</code> to be deleted from the
              repository.  If <code class="filename">foo</code> is a file or
              link, it is immediately deleted from your working copy.
              If <code class="filename">foo</code> is a directory, it is not
              deleted, but Subversion schedules it for deletion.  When
              you commit your changes, <code class="filename">foo</code> will
              be entirely removed from your working copy and the
              repository.
              <sup>[<a name="id483382" href="#ftn.id483382" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup>
            </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy foo bar</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>Create a new item <code class="filename">bar</code> as a
              duplicate of <code class="filename">foo</code> and automatically
              schedule <code class="filename">bar</code> for addition.  When
              <code class="filename">bar</code> is added to the repository on
              the next commit, its copy history is recorded (as having
              originally come from <code class="filename">foo</code>).
              <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> does not create intermediate
              directories unless you pass the
              <code class="option">--parents</code> option.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn move foo bar</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command is exactly the same as running
              <strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy foo bar; svn delete foo</code></strong>.
              That is, <code class="filename">bar</code> is scheduled for
              addition as a copy of <code class="filename">foo</code>, and
              <code class="filename">foo</code> is scheduled for removal.
              <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> does not create intermediate
              directories unless you pass the
              <code class="option">--parents</code> option.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn mkdir blort</code></strong></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command is exactly the same as running
              <strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir blort; svn add blort</code></strong>.  That is,
              a new directory named <code class="filename">blort</code> is
              created and scheduled for addition.</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Changing the Repository Without a Working Copy</b></p>
<p>There <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> some use cases that
          immediately commit tree changes to the repository.  This
          happens only when a subcommand is operating directly on a
          URL, rather than on a working-copy path.  In particular,
          specific uses of <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>, and
          <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> can work with URLs (and don't
          forget that <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> always makes
          changes to a URL).</p>
<p>URL operations behave in this manner because commands
          that operate on a working copy can use the working copy as a
          sort of &#8220;<span class="quote">staging area</span>&#8221; to set up your changes
          before committing them to the repository.  Commands that
          operate on URLs don't have this luxury, so when you operate
          directly on a URL, any of the aforementioned actions represents an
          immediate commit.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.examine"></a>2.4.3. Examine Your Changes</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit
        them to the repository, but before you do so, it's usually a
        good idea to take a look at exactly what you've changed.  By
        examining your changes before you commit, you can make a more
        accurate log message.  You may also discover that you've
        inadvertently changed a file, and this gives you a chance to
        revert those changes before committing.  Additionally, this is
        a good opportunity to review and scrutinize changes before
        publishing them.  You can see an overview of the changes
        you've made by using <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>, and dig
        into the details of those changes by using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff</strong></span>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Look Ma! No Network!</b></p>
<p>You can use the commands <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>,
          <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          revert</strong></span> without any network access even
          if your repository <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> across the
          network.  This makes it easy to manage your
          changes-in-progress when you are somewhere without a network
          connection, such as traveling on an airplane, riding a
          commuter train, or hacking on the beach.
          <sup>[<a name="id483642" href="#ftn.id483642" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup>
        </p>
<p>Subversion does this by keeping private caches of
          pristine versions of each versioned file inside the
          <code class="filename">.svn</code> administrative areas.  This allows
          Subversion to report&#8212;and revert&#8212;local
          modifications to those files <span class="emphasis"><em>without network
          access</em></span>.  This cache (called the
          &#8220;<span class="quote">text-base</span>&#8221;) also allows Subversion to send the
          user's local modifications during a commit to the server as
          a compressed <em class="firstterm">delta</em> (or
          &#8220;<span class="quote">difference</span>&#8221;) against the pristine version.
          Having this cache is a tremendous benefit&#8212;even if you
          have a fast Internet connection, it's much faster to send only a
          file's changes rather than the whole file to the
          server.</p>
</div>
<p>Subversion has been optimized to help you with this task,
        and it is able to do many things without communicating with
        the repository.  In particular, your working copy contains a
        hidden cached &#8220;<span class="quote">pristine</span>&#8221; copy of each version-controlled
        file within the <code class="filename">.svn</code> area.
        Because of this, Subversion can quickly show you how your
        working files have changed or even allow you to undo your
        changes without contacting the repository.</p>
<div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.examine.status"></a>2.4.3.1. See an overview of your changes</h4></div></div></div>
<p>To get an overview of your changes, you'll use the
          <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> command.  You'll probably use
          <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> more than any other Subversion
          command.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>CVS Users: Hold That Update!</b></p>
<p>You're probably used to using <span class="command"><strong>cvs
            update</strong></span> to see what changes you've made to your
            working copy.  <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> will give you
            all the information you need regarding what has changed in
            your working copy&#8212;without accessing the repository
            or potentially incorporating new changes published by
            other users.</p>
<p>In Subversion, <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> does just
            that&#8212;it updates your working copy with any changes
            committed to the repository since the last time you
            updated your working copy.  You may have to break the
            habit of using the <span class="command"><strong>update</strong></span> command to
            see what local modifications you've made.</p>
</div>
<p>If you run <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> at the top of
          your working copy with no arguments, it will detect all file
          and tree changes you've made.  Here are a few examples of
          the most common status codes that <span class="command"><strong>svn
          status</strong></span> can return.  (Note that the text following
          <code class="literal">#</code> is not
          actually printed by <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.)</p>
<pre class="screen">
?       scratch.c           # file is not under version control
A       stuff/loot/bloo.h   # file is scheduled for addition
C       stuff/loot/lump.c   # file has textual conflicts from an update
D       stuff/fish.c        # file is scheduled for deletion
M       bar.c               # the content in bar.c has local modifications
</pre>
<p>In this output format, <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>
          prints six columns of characters, followed by several
          whitespace characters, followed by a file or directory name.
          The first column tells the status of a file or directory
          and/or its contents.  The codes we listed are:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">A      item</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The file, directory, or symbolic link
                <code class="filename">item</code> has been scheduled for
                addition into the repository.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">C      item</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The file <code class="filename">item</code> is in a state
                of conflict.  That is, changes received from the
                server during an update overlap with local changes
                that you have in your working copy (and weren't
                resolved during the update).  You must resolve this
                conflict before committing your changes to the
                repository.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">D      item</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The file, directory, or symbolic link

<pre class="screen">

<p><span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> also has a

<p>None of the prior invocations to <span class="command"><strong>svn

          compare the metadata in the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
          directory with the working copy.  Finally, there is the
          <code class="option">--show-updates</code> (<code class="option">-u</code>)
          option, which contacts the repository and adds information
          about things that are out of date:</p>

<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> command produces this
          output by comparing your working files against the cached
          &#8220;<span class="quote">pristine</span>&#8221; copies within the
          <code class="filename">.svn</code> area.  Files scheduled for
          addition are displayed as all added text, and files
          scheduled for deletion are displayed as all deleted
          text.</p>
<p>Output is displayed in unified diff format.  That is,
          removed lines are prefaced with <code class="literal">-</code>, and
          added lines are prefaced with
          <code class="literal">+</code>.  <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> also
          prints filename and offset information useful to the
          <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program, so you can generate
          &#8220;<span class="quote">patches</span>&#8221; by redirecting the diff output to a
          file:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn diff &gt; patchfile

<p>You could, for example, email the patch file to another
          developer for review or testing prior to a commit.</p>
<p>Subversion uses its internal diff engine, which produces
          unified diff format, by default.  If you want diff output in
          a different format, specify an external diff program using
          <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and pass any flags you'd like to
          it using the <code class="option">--extensions</code>
          (<code class="option">-x</code>) option.  For example, to see local
          differences in file <code class="filename">foo.c</code> in context
          output format while ignoring case differences, you might run
          <strong class="userinput"><code>svn diff --diff-cmd /usr/bin/diff --extensions '-i'

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.resolve.resolve"></a>2.4.5.2. Resolving conflict differences interactively</h4></div></div></div>
<p>There are four different ways to resolve conflicts
          interactively&#8212;two of which allow you to selectively
          merge and edit changes, and two of which allow you to simply
          pick a version of the file and move along.</p>
<p>If you wish to choose some combination of your local
          changes, you can use the &#8220;<span class="quote">edit</span>&#8221; command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>e</code></strong>) to manually edit the file with
          conflict markers in a text editor (determined by the
          <code class="literal">EDITOR</code> environment variable).  Editing
          the file by hand in your favorite text editor is a somewhat
          low-tech way of remedying conflicts (see <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve.byhand" title="2.4.5.4. Merging conflicts by hand">Section 2.4.5.4, &#8220;Merging conflicts by hand&#8221;</a> for a
          walkthrough), so some people like to use fancy graphical
          merge tools instead.</p>
<p>To use a merge tool, you need to either set the
          <code class="literal">SVN_MERGE</code> environment variable or define
          the <code class="literal">merge-tool-cmd</code> option in your
          Subversion configuration file (see <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts" title="7.1.3. Configuration Options">Section 7.1.3, &#8220;Configuration Options&#8221;</a> for more details).
          Subversion will pass four arguments to the merge tool: the
          <code class="literal">BASE</code> revision of the file, the revision
          of the file received from the server as part of the update,
          the copy of the file containing your local edits, and
          the merged copy of the file (which contains conflict
          markers).  If your merge tool is expecting arguments in a
          different order or format, you'll need to write a wrapper
          script for Subversion to invoke.  After you've edited the
          file, if you're satisfied with the changes you've made, you
          can tell Subversion that the edited file is no longer in
          conflict by using the &#8220;<span class="quote">resolve</span>&#8221; command
          (<code class="literal">r</code>).</p>
<p>If you decide that you don't need to merge any changes,
          but just want to accept one version of the file or the
          other, you can either choose your changes (a.k.a.
          &#8220;<span class="quote">mine</span>&#8221;) by using the &#8220;<span class="quote">mine-full</span>&#8221;
          command (<strong class="userinput"><code>mf</code></strong>) or choose theirs by using the
          &#8220;<span class="quote">theirs-full</span>&#8221; command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>tf</code></strong>).</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cycle.resolve.pending"></a>2.4.5.3. Postponing conflict resolution</h4></div></div></div>
<p>This may sound like an appropriate section for avoiding
          marital disagreements, but it's actually still about
          Subversion, so read on.  If you're doing an update and
          encounter a conflict that you're not prepared to review or
          resolve, you can type <strong class="userinput"><code>p</code></strong> to postpone
          resolving a conflict on a file-by-file basis when you run
          <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong>.  If you're running an update
          and don't want to resolve any conflicts, you can pass the
          <code class="option">--non-interactive</code> option to <span class="command"><strong>svn
          update</strong></span>, and any file in conflict will be marked
          with a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
          automatically.</p>
<p>The <code class="computeroutput">C</code> stands for
          <code class="computeroutput">c</code>onflict.  This means that
          the changes from the server overlapped with your own, and
          now you have to manually choose between them after the
          update has completed.  When you postpone a conflict
          resolution, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> typically does three
          things to assist you in noticing and resolving that
          conflict:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Subversion prints a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
              during the update and remembers that the file is in a
              state of conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>If Subversion considers the file to be mergeable, it
              places <em class="firstterm">conflict
              markers</em>&#8212;special strings of text that
              delimit the &#8220;<span class="quote">sides</span>&#8221; of the
              conflict&#8212;into the file to visibly demonstrate the
              overlapping areas.  (Subversion uses the
              <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to decide whether a
              file is capable of contextual, line-based merging.  See
              <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. File Content Type">Section 3.3.1, &#8220;File Content Type&#8221;</a>
              to learn more.)</p></li>
<li>
<p>For every conflicted file, Subversion places three
              extra unversioned files in your working copy:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">filename.mine</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is your file as it existed in your working
                    copy before you updated your working copy&#8212;that
                    is, without conflict markers.  This file has only
                    your latest changes in it.  (If Subversion considers
                    the file to be unmergeable, the
                    <code class="filename">.mine</code> file isn't created, since
                    it would be identical to the working file.)</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">filename.r<em class="replaceable"><code>OLDREV</code></em>
                      </code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the file that was the
                    <code class="literal">BASE</code> revision before you updated
                    your working copy.  That is, the file that you
                    checked out before you made your latest
                    edits.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">filename.r<em class="replaceable"><code>NEWREV</code></em>

<dd><p>This is the file that your Subversion client
                    just received from the server when you updated your
                    working copy.  This file corresponds to the
                    <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision of the
                    repository.</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>Here <em class="replaceable"><code>OLDREV</code></em> is the revision number
              of the file in your <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory,
              and <em class="replaceable"><code>NEWREV</code></em> is the revision number of
              the repository <code class="literal">HEAD</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>For example, Sally makes changes to the file
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code>, but does not yet commit
          those changes.  Meanwhile, Harry commits changes to that
          same file.  Sally updates her working copy before committing
          and she gets a conflict, which she postpones:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn update
Conflict discovered in 'sandwich.txt'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h)elp for more options : p
C  sandwich.txt
Updated to revision 2.
$ ls -1
sandwich.txt
sandwich.txt.mine
sandwich.txt.r1
sandwich.txt.r2
</pre>
<p>At this point, Subversion will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
          allow Sally to commit the file
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> until the three temporary
          files are removed:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Add a few more things"
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Aborting commit: '/home/sally/svn-work/sandwich.txt' remains in conflict
</pre>
<p>If you've postponed a conflict, you need to resolve the
          conflict before Subversion will allow you to commit your
          changes.  You'll do this with the <span class="command"><strong>svn
          resolve</strong></span> command and one of several arguments to
          the <code class="option">--accept</code> option.</p>
<p>If you want to choose the version of the file that you
          last checked out before making your edits, choose
          the <em class="replaceable"><code>base</code></em> argument.</p>
<p>If you want to choose the version that contains only
          your edits, choose the <em class="replaceable"><code>mine-full</code></em>
          argument.</p>
<p>If you want to choose the version that your most recent
          update pulled from the server (and thus discarding your
          edits entirely), choose
          the <em class="replaceable"><code>theirs-full</code></em> argument.</p>
<p>However, if you want to pick and choose from your
          changes and the changes that your update fetched from the
          server, merge the conflicted text &#8220;<span class="quote">by hand</span>&#8221; (by
          examining and editing the conflict markers within the file)
          and then choose the <em class="replaceable"><code>working</code></em>
          argument.</p>
<p><span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span> removes the three
          temporary files and accepts the version of the file that you
          specified with the <code class="option">--accept</code> option, and
          Subversion no longer considers the file to be in a state of

<p>Here's an example.  Due to a miscommunication, you and

          commits her changes, and when you go to update your working

          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> to resolve the conflict.
          First, let's take a look at the file:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ cat sandwich.txt
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
Creole Mustard
Bottom piece of bread
</pre>
<p>The strings of less-than signs, equals signs, and
          greater-than signs are conflict markers and are not part of
          the actual data in conflict.  You generally want to ensure
          that those are removed from the file before your next
          commit.  The text between the first two sets of markers is
          composed of the changes you made in the conflicting
          area:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======
</pre>
<p>The text between the second and third sets of conflict
          markers is the text from Sally's commit:</p>
<pre class="screen">
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
</pre>
<p>Usually you won't want to just delete the conflict
          markers and Sally's changes&#8212;she's going to be awfully
          surprised when the sandwich arrives and it's not what she
          wanted.  This is where you pick up the phone or walk
          across the office and explain to Sally that you can't get
          sauerkraut from an Italian deli.
          <sup>[<a name="id485155" href="#ftn.id485155" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>
          Once you've agreed on the changes you will commit, edit
          your file and remove the conflict markers:</p>
<pre class="screen">
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
Creole Mustard

</pre>
<p>Now use <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, and you're
          ready to commit your changes:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn resolve --accept working sandwich.txt
Resolved conflicted state of 'sandwich.txt'
$ svn commit -m "Go ahead and use my sandwich, discarding Sally's edits."
</pre>
<p>Note that <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, unlike most of
          the other commands we deal with in this chapter, requires
          that you explicitly list any filenames that you wish to
          resolve.  In any case, you want to be careful and use
          <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span> only when you're certain that
          you've fixed the conflict in your file&#8212;once the
          temporary files are removed, Subversion will let you commit
          the file even if it still contains conflict markers.</p>
<p>If you ever get confused while editing the conflicted
          file, you can always consult the three files that Subversion
          creates for you in your working copy&#8212;including your
          file as it was before you updated.  You can even use a
          third-party interactive merging tool to examine those three
          files.</p>

<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command sends all of
        your changes to the repository.  When you commit a change, you
        need to supply a <em class="firstterm">log message</em>
        describing your change.  Your log message will be attached to
        the new revision you create.  If your log message is brief,
        you may wish to supply it on the command line using the
        <code class="option">--message</code> (or <code class="option">-m</code>)
        option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Corrected number of cheese slices."

</pre>
<p>However, if you've been composing your log message as you
        work, you may want to tell Subversion to get the message from
        a file by passing the filename with the

<pre class="screen">

<p>If you fail to specify either the
        <code class="option">--message</code> or <code class="option">--file</code> option,
        Subversion will automatically launch your favorite editor
        (see the information on <code class="literal">editor-cmd</code> in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="7.1.3.2. Config">Section 7.1.3.2, &#8220;Config&#8221;</a>) for composing a log

<p>The repository doesn't know or care whether your changes make

        else has changed any of the same files that you did when you
        weren't looking.  If somebody <span class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> done
        that, the entire commit will fail with a message informing you
        that one or more of your files are out of date:</p>

<p>(The exact wording of this error message depends on the
        network protocol and server you're using, but the idea is the
        same in all cases.)</p>
<p>At this point, you need to run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        update</code></strong>, deal with any merges or conflicts that
        result, and attempt your commit again.</p>
<p>That covers the basic work cycle for using Subversion.
        Subversion offers many other features that you can use
        to manage your repository and working copy, but most of your
        day-to-day use of Subversion will involve only the commands
        that we've discussed so far in this chapter.  We will,
        however, cover a few more commands that you'll use fairly
        often.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="svn.tour.history"></a>2.5. Examining History</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Your Subversion repository is like a time machine.  It keeps
      a record of every change ever committed and allows you to
      explore this history by examining previous versions of files and
      directories as well as the metadata that accompanies them.  With
      a single Subversion command, you can check out the repository
      (or restore an existing working copy) exactly as it was at any
      date or revision number in the past.  However, sometimes you
      just want to <span class="emphasis"><em>peer into</em></span> the past instead of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>going into</em></span> it.</p>
<p>Several commands can provide you with
      historical data from the repository:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>Shows you broad information: log messages with date
              and author information attached to revisions and which
              paths changed in each revision</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>Shows line-level details of a particular change</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>svn cat</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>Retrieves a file as it existed in a particular
              revision number and displays it on your screen</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>svn list</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>Displays the files in a directory for any given

<a name="svn.tour.history.log"></a>2.5.1. Generating a List of Historical Changes</h3></div></div></div>
<p>To find information about the history of a file or
        directory, use the <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>
        command. <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> will provide you with a
        record of who made changes to a file or directory, at what
        revision it changed, the time and date of that revision,
        and&#8212;if it was provided&#8212;the log message that accompanied
        the commit:</p>

<p>Note that the log messages are printed in
        <span class="emphasis"><em>reverse chronological order</em></span> by default.
        If you wish to see a different range of revisions in a
        particular order or just a single revision, pass the
        <code class="option">--revision</code> (<code class="option">-r</code>)
        option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn log -r 5:19    # shows logs 5 through 19 in chronological order

$ svn log -r 19:5    # shows logs 5 through 19 in reverse order

$ svn log -r 8       # shows log for revision 8
</pre>
<p>You can also examine the log history of a single file or
        directory.  For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn log foo.c
&#8230;
$ svn log http://foo.com/svn/trunk/code/foo.c
&#8230;
</pre>
<p>These will display log messages <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
        for those revisions in which the working file (or URL)
        changed.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Why Does svn log Not Show Me What I
          Just Committed?</b></p>
<p>If you make a commit and immediately type <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
          log</code></strong> with no arguments, you may notice that your
          most recent commit doesn't show up in the list of log
          messages.  This is due to a combination of the behavior of
          <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> and the default behavior of
          <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>.  First, when you commit changes
          to the repository, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> bumps only the
          revision of files (and directories) that it commits, so
          usually the parent directory remains at the older revision
          (See
          <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.html#svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit" title="1.3.5.1. Updates and commits are separate">Section 1.3.5.1, &#8220;Updates and commits are separate&#8221;</a>
          for an explanation of why).  <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> then
          defaults to fetching the history of the directory at its
          current revision, and thus you don't see the newly committed
          changes.  The solution here is to either update your working
          copy or explicitly provide a revision number to <span class="command"><strong>svn
          log</strong></span> by using the <code class="option">--revision</code>
          (<code class="option">-r</code>) option.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want even more information about a file or
        directory, <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> also takes a
        <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>) option.
        Because Subversion allows you to move and copy files and
        directories, it is important to be able to track path changes
        in the filesystem. So, in verbose mode, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        log</strong></span> will include a list of changed paths in a
        revision in its output:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn log -r 8 -v
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r8 | sally | 2008-05-21 13:19:25 -0500 (Wed, 21 May 2008) | 1 line
Changed paths:
   M /trunk/code/foo.c
   M /trunk/code/bar.h
   A /trunk/code/doc/README

Frozzled the sub-space winch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
        <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> also takes a <code class="option">--quiet</code>
        (<code class="option">-q</code>) option, which suppresses the body of the
        log message.  When combined with <code class="option">--verbose</code>, it
        gives just the names of the changed files.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Why Does svn log Give Me an Empty
          Response?</b></p>
<p>After working with Subversion for a bit, most users will
          come across something like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn log -r 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$
</pre>
<p>At first glance, this seems like an error.  But recall
          that while revisions are repository-wide, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          log</strong></span> operates on a path in the repository.  If you
          supply no path, Subversion uses the current working
          directory as the default target.  As a result, if you're
          operating in a subdirectory of your working copy and attempt
          to see the log of a revision in which neither that directory
          nor any of its children was changed, Subversion will show you
          an empty log.  If you want to see what changed in that
          revision, try pointing <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> directly at
          the topmost URL of your repository, as in <strong class="userinput"><code>svn log -r 2
          http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn</code></strong>.</p>

        you can use <span class="command"><strong>svn export</strong></span> to create a local
        copy of all or part of your repository
        sans <code class="filename">.svn</code> directories.  As
        with <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>, you can also pass the
        <code class="option">--revision</code> option to <span class="command"><strong>svn

<a name="svn.tour.cleanup"></a>2.6. Sometimes You Just Need to Clean Up</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Now that we've covered the day-to-day tasks that you'll
      frequently use Subversion for, we'll review a few administrative
      tasks relating to your working copy.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cleanup.disposal"></a>2.6.1. Disposing of a Working Copy</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Subversion doesn't track either the state or the existence of
        working copies on the server, so there's no server overhead to
        keeping working copies around.  Likewise, there's no need to
        let the server know that you're going to delete a working
        copy.</p>
<p>If you're likely to use a working copy again, there's
        nothing wrong with just leaving it on disk until you're ready
        to use it again, at which point all it takes is an
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring it up to date and ready
        for use.</p>
<p>However, if you're definitely not going to use a working
        copy again, you can safely delete the entire thing, but you'd
        be well served to take a look through the working copy for
        unversioned files.  To find these files, run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        status</code></strong> and review any files that are prefixed with a
        <code class="literal">?</code> to make certain that they're not of
        importance.  After you're done reviewing, you can safely
        delete your working copy.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.cleanup.interruption"></a>2.6.2. Recovering from an Interruption</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When Subversion modifies your working copy (or any
        information within <code class="filename">.svn</code>), it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing the working copy,
        Subversion writes its intentions to a logfile.  Next, it
        executes the commands in the logfile to apply the requested
        change, holding a lock on the relevant part of the working
        copy while it works&#8212;to prevent other Subversion clients
        from accessing the working copy mid-change.  Finally,
        Subversion removes the logfile.  Architecturally, this is
        similar to a journaled filesystem.  If a Subversion operation
        is interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or if the machine
        crashes), the logfiles remain on disk.  By
        reexecuting the logfiles, Subversion can complete the
        previously started operation, and your working copy can get
        itself back into a consistent state.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what <span class="command"><strong>svn cleanup</strong></span>
        does: it searches your working copy and runs any leftover
        logs, removing working copy locks in the process.
        If Subversion ever tells you that some part of your working copy
        is &#8220;<span class="quote">locked,</span>&#8221; this is the command that you
        should run.  Also, <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> will display
        an <code class="literal">L</code> next to locked items:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status
  L    somedir
M      somedir/foo.c

$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M      somedir/foo.c
</pre>
<p>Don't confuse these working copy locks with the ordinary
        locks that Subversion users create when using
        the lock-modify-unlock model of concurrent
        version control; see the sidebar
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.html#svn.advanced.locking.meanings" title="The Three Meanings of &#8220;Lock&#8221;">The Three Meanings of &#8220;<span class="quote">Lock</span>&#8221;</a> for

<a name="svn.tour.treeconflicts"></a>2.7. Dealing with Structural Conflicts</h2></div></div></div>
<p>So far, we have only talked about conflicts at the level
        of file content. When you and your collaborators make overlapping
        changes within the same file, Subversion forces you to merge those
        changes before you can commit.<sup>[<a name="id486349" href="#ftn.id486349" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup></p>
<p>But what happens if your collaborators move or delete a file
        that you are still working on? Maybe there was a miscommunication,
        and one person thinks the file should be deleted, while another
        person still wants to commit changes to the file. Or maybe your
        collaborators did some refactoring, renaming files and moving
        around directories in the process. If you were still working on
        these files, those modifications may need to be applied to the
        files at their new location. Such conflicts manifest themselves at
        the directory tree structure level rather than at the file content
        level, and are known as <em class="firstterm">tree conflicts</em>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6</b></p>
<p>Prior to Subversion 1.6, tree conflicts could yield
          rather unexpected results. For example, if a file was
          locally modified, but had been renamed in the repository,
          running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> would make Subversion
          carry out the following steps:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Check the file to be renamed for local
            modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the file at its old location, and
            if it had local modifications, keep an on-disk copy
            of the file at the old location. This on-disk copy
            now appears as an unversioned file in the working
            copy.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the file, as it exists in the repository,
            at its new location.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>When this situation arises, there is the possibility
          that the user makes a commit without realizing that local
          modifications have been left in a now-unversioned file in
          the working copy, and have not reached the repository.
          This gets more and more likely (and tedious) if the number
          of files affected by this problem is large.</p>
<p>Since Subversion 1.6, this and other similar situations
          are flagged as conflicts in the working copy.</p>
</div>
<p>As with textual conflicts, tree conflicts prevent a commit
        from being made from the conflicted state, giving the user the
        opportunity to examine the state of the working copy for potential
        problems arising from the tree conflict, and resolving any such
        problems before committing.</p>

<p>Suppose a software project you were working on currently
       looked like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">

</pre>
<p>Your collaborator Harry has renamed the file
        <code class="filename">bar.c</code> to <code class="filename">baz.c</code>.
        You are still working on <code class="filename">bar.c</code> in your
        working copy, but you don't know yet that the file has
        been renamed in the repository.</p>

Summary of conflicts:

<p>In its output, <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> signifies tree
        conflicts using a capital C in the fourth output column.
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> reveals additional details of the
        conflict:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M       code/foo.c
A  +  C code/bar.c
      &gt;   local edit, incoming delete upon update
M       code/baz.c
</pre>
<p>Note how bar.c is automatically scheduled for re-addition
        in your working copy, which simplifies things in case you want
        to keep the file.</p>
<p>Because a move in Subversion is implemented as a copy operation
        followed by a delete operation, and these two operations cannot
        be easily related to one another during an update, all Subversion
        can warn you about is an incoming delete operation on a locally
        modified file.
        This delete operation <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be part of a move,
        or it could be a genuine delete operation. Talking to your
        collaborators, or, as a last resort, <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>,
        is a good way to find out what has actually happened.</p>
<p>Both <code class="filename">foo.c</code> and <code class="filename">baz.c</code>
        are reported as locally modified in the output of
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.  You made the changes to
        <code class="filename">foo.c</code> yourself, so this should not be
        surprising. But why is <code class="filename">baz.c</code> reported as
        locally modified?</p>
<p>
        The answer is that despite the limitations of the move implementation,
        Subversion was smart enough to transfer your local edits in
        <code class="filename">bar.c</code> into <code class="filename">baz.c</code>:</p>
