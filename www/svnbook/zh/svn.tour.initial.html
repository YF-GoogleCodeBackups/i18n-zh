<p>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion repository by doing a
<em class="firstterm">checkout</em> of your project.  Checking out a repository
creates a “<span class="quote">working copy</span>” of it on your local machine.  This
copy contains the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> (latest revision) of the
Subversion repository that you specify on the command line:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk
A    trunk/Makefile.in
A    trunk/ac-helpers
A    trunk/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    trunk/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    trunk/build.conf

<p class="title"><b>名称中有什么？</b></p>
<p>Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you can place under
version control.  The contents of files and property values are stored and
transmitted as binary data, and <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. 文件内容类型">第 3.3.1 节 “文件内容类型”</a> tells you how to give
Subversion a hint that “<span class="quote">textual</span>” operations don't make sense
for a particular file.  There are a few places, however, where Subversion
places restrictions on information it stores.</p>
<p>Subversion internally handles certain bits of data—for example,
property names, pathnames, and log messages—as UTF-8-encoded
Unicode.  This is not to say that all your interactions with Subversion must
involve UTF-8, though.  As a general rule, Subversion clients will
gracefully and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion can
meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common encodings in use
today).</p>
<p>In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of Subversion's
administrative files, paths are used as XML attribute values, and property
names in XML tag names.  This means that pathnames can contain only legal
XML (1.0)  characters, and properties are further limited to ASCII
characters.  Subversion also prohibits <code class="literal">TAB</code>,
<code class="literal">CR</code>, and <code class="literal">LF</code> characters in path names to
prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or in the output of commands
such as <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice these limitations are
rarely a problem.  As long as your locale settings are compatible with UTF-8
and you don't use control characters in path names, you should have no
trouble communicating with Subversion.  The command-line client adds an
extra bit of help—to create “<span class="quote">legally correct</span>” versions
for internal use it will automatically escape illegal path characters as
needed in URLs that you type.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk directory, you can just
as easily check out any deep subdirectory of a repository by specifying the
subdirectory in the checkout URL:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout \
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/tests/cmdline/
A    cmdline/revert_tests.py
A    cmdline/diff_tests.py
A    cmdline/autoprop_tests.py
A    cmdline/xmltests
A    cmdline/xmltests/svn-test.sh
…

<p>Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge model instead of
lock-modify-unlock (see <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.vsn-models.html" title="1.2. 版本模型">第 1.2 节 “版本模型”</a>), you can
immediately make changes to the files and directories in your working copy.
Your working copy is just like any other collection of files and directories
on your system.  You can edit and change it, move it around, even delete the
entire working copy and forget about it.</p>
<div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning">

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While your working copy is “<span class="quote">just like any other collection of files
and directories on your system,</span>” you can edit files at will, but you
must tell Subversion about <span class="emphasis"><em>everything else</em></span> that you
do.  For example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working copy, you
should use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>
instead of the copy and move commands provided by your operating system.
We'll talk more about them later in this chapter.</p></td></tr>

<p>除非你准备好了提交一个新文件或目录，或改变了已存在的，否则没有必要通知Subversion你做了什么。</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>目录 .svn 中有什么？</b></p>
<p>Every directory in a working copy contains an administrative area—a
subdirectory named <code class="filename">.svn</code>.  Usually, directory listing
commands won't show this subdirectory, but it is nevertheless an important
directory.  Whatever you do, don't delete or change anything in the
administrative area! Subversion depends on it to manage your working copy.</p>
<p>If you accidentally remove the <code class="filename">.svn</code> subdirectory, the
easiest way to fix the problem is to remove the entire containing directory
(a normal system deletion, not <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span>), then run
<strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong> from a parent directory.  The Subversion
client will download the directory you've deleted, with a new
<code class="filename">.svn</code> area as well.</p>
</div>
<p>While you can certainly check out a working copy with the URL of the
repository as the only argument, you can also specify a directory after your
repository URL.  This places your working copy in the new directory that you
name.  For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$  svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
A    subv/Makefile.in
A    subv/ac-helpers
A    subv/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    subv/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    subv/build.conf
…
Checked out revision 8810.
</pre>
<p>That will place your working copy in a directory named
<code class="literal">subv</code> instead of a directory named
<code class="literal">trunk</code> as we did previously.  The directory
<code class="literal">subv</code> will be created if it doesn't already exist.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.initial.disabling-password-caching"></a>2.3.1. 禁用密码缓存</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When you perform a Subversion operation that requires you to authenticate,
by default Subversion tries to cache your authentication credentials on disk
in encrypted form.  On some systems, Subversion may be unable to encrypt
your authentication data. You will then be asked whether you want to cache
your credentials to disk in plaintext.  You can choose to do so for
convenience so that you don't have to continually reenter your password for
future operations.  If you're concerned about caching your Subversion
passwords in plaintext and do not want to be asked about it again and again,
you can disable caching of plaintext passwords either permanently, or on a
server-per-server basis.</p>
<p>To permanently disable caching of passwords in plaintext, you can add the
line <code class="literal">store-plaintext-passwords = no</code> to the global section
in the <code class="filename">servers</code> configuration file on the local
machine.  To disable caching of plaintext passwords for a particular server,
use the same setting in the appropriate group section in the
<code class="filename">servers</code> configuration file.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts" title="7.1.3. 配置选项">第 7.1.3 节 “配置选项”</a> in <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html" title="第 7 章 定制你的 Subversion 体验">第 7 章 <i>定制你的 Subversion 体验</i></a> for details.</p>
<p>You can also disable caching of authentication credentials entirely,
regardless of whether the credentials are stored in encrypted form or not.</p>
<p>To disable password caching entirely for a particular one-time command, pass
the <code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code> option on the command line.  To
permanently disable caching entirely, you can add the line
<code class="literal">store-passwords = no</code> to your local machine's Subversion
configuration file.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="3.11.2. 客户端凭证缓存">第 3.11.2 节 “客户端凭证缓存”</a> for details.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.tour.initial.different-user"></a>2.3.2. 认证为其它用户</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Since Subversion caches auth credentials by default (both username and
password), it conveniently remembers who you were acting as the last time
you modified your working copy.  But sometimes that's not
helpful—particularly if you're working in a shared working copy such
as a system configuration directory or a web server document root.  In this
case, just pass the <code class="option">--username</code> option on the command line,
and Subversion will attempt to authenticate as that user, prompting you for
a password if necessary.</p>
