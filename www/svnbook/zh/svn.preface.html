    <a class="indexterm" name="id311697"></a> In the world of open source software,
the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) was the tool of choice for version
control for many years.  And rightly so.  CVS was open source software
itself, and its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for networked
operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed programmers to share
their work.  It fit the collaborative nature of the open source world very
well.  CVS and its semi-chaotic development model have since become
cornerstones of open source culture.</p>
<p>But CVS was not without its flaws, and simply fixing those flaws promised to
be an enormous effort.  Enter Subversion.  Subversion was designed to be a
successor to CVS, and its originators set out to win the hearts of CVS users
in two ways—by creating an open source system with a design (and
“<span class="quote">look and feel</span>”) similar to CVS, and by attempting to avoid
most of CVS's noticeable flaws.  While the result isn't necessarily the next
great evolution in version control design, Subversion
<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> very powerful, very usable, and very flexible.  And
for the most part, almost all newly started open source projects now choose
Subversion instead of CVS.</p>
<p>This book is written to document the 1.6 series of the Subversion version
control system.  We have made every attempt to be thorough in our coverage.
However, Subversion has a thriving and energetic development community, so
already a number of features and improvements are planned for future
versions that may change some of the commands and specific notes in this
book.</p>

<p>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to use Subversion
to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a number of different
operating systems, its primary user interface is command-line-based.  That
command-line tool (<span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>), and some auxiliary programs, are
the focus of this book.</p>
<p>For consistency, the examples in this book assume that the reader is using a
Unix-like operating system and is relatively comfortable with Unix and
command-line interfaces.  That said, the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program also
runs on non-Unix platforms such as Microsoft Windows.  With a few minor
exceptions, such as the use of backward slashes (<code class="literal">\</code>)
instead of forward slashes (<code class="literal">/</code>) for path separators, the
input to and output from this tool when run on Windows are identical to its
Unix counterpart.</p>
<p>Most readers are probably programmers or system administrators who need to
track changes to source code.  This is the most common use for Subversion,
and therefore it is the scenario underlying all of the book's examples.  But
Subversion can be used to manage changes to any sort of
information—images, music, databases, documentation, and so on.  To
Subversion, all data is just data.</p>
<p>While this book is written with the assumption that the reader has never
used a version control system, we've also tried to make it easy for users of
CVS (and other systems) to make a painless leap into Subversion.  Special
sidebars may mention other version control systems from time to time, and
Appendix B summarizes many of the differences between CVS and Subversion.</p>
<p>Note also that the source code examples used throughout the book are only
examples.  While they will compile with the proper compiler incantations,
they are intended to illustrate a particular scenario and not necessarily to
serve as examples of good programming style or practices.</p>
