<p>Version control can be a complex subject, as much art as
    science, that offers myriad ways of getting stuff done.
    Throughout this book, you've read of the various Subversion
    command-line client subcommands and the options that modify their
    behavior.  In this chapter, we'll look into still more ways to
    customize the way Subversion works for you&#8212;setting up the
    Subversion runtime configuration, using external helper
    applications, Subversion's interaction with the operating system's
    configured locale, and so on.</p>
<div class="sect1" lang="de">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="svn.advanced.confarea"></a>7.1. Runtime Configuration Area</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Subversion provides many optional behaviors that the user can
      control.  Many of these options are of the kind
      that a user would wish to apply to all Subversion operations.
      So, rather than forcing users to remember command-line arguments
      for specifying these options and to use them for every
      operation they perform, Subversion uses configuration files,
      segregated into a Subversion configuration area.</p>
<p>The Subversion <em class="firstterm">configuration area</em> is
      a two-tiered hierarchy of option names and their values.
      Usually, this boils down to a special directory that contains
      <em class="firstterm">configuration files</em> (the first tier),
      which are just text files in standard INI format (with
      &#8222;<span class="quote">sections</span>&#8220; providing the second tier).  You can
      easily edit these files using your favorite text editor (such as
      Emacs or vi), and they contain directives read by the client to
      determine which of several optional behaviors the user
      prefers.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="de">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.confarea.layout"></a>7.1.1. Configuration Area Layout</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The first time the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        command-line client is executed, it creates a per-user
        configuration area.  On Unix-like systems, this area appears
        as a directory named <code class="filename">.subversion</code> in the
        user's home directory.  On Win32 systems, Subversion creates a
        folder named <code class="filename">Subversion</code>, typically inside
        the <code class="filename">Application Data</code> area of the user's
        profile directory (which, by the way, is usually a hidden
        directory).  However, on this platform, the exact location
        differs from system to system and is dictated by the Windows
        Registry.
        <sup>[<a name="id407010" href="#ftn.id407010" class="footnote">48</a>]</sup>
        We will refer to the per-user configuration area using its Unix
        name, <code class="filename">.subversion</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to the per-user configuration area, Subversion
        also recognizes the existence of a system-wide configuration
        area.  This gives system administrators the ability to
        establish defaults for all users on a given machine.  Note
        that the system-wide configuration area alone does not dictate
        mandatory policy&#8212;the settings in the per-user
        configuration area override those in the system-wide one, and
        command-line arguments supplied to the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        program have the final word on behavior.  On Unix-like
        platforms, the system-wide configuration area is
        expected to be the <code class="filename">/etc/subversion</code>
        directory; on Windows machines, it looks for a
        <code class="filename">Subversion</code> directory inside the common
        <code class="filename">Application Data</code> location (again, as
        specified by the Windows Registry).  Unlike the per-user
        case, the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program does not attempt
        to create the system-wide configuration area.</p>
<p>The per-user configuration area currently contains three
        files&#8212;two configuration files (<code class="filename">config</code> and
        <code class="filename">servers</code>), and a <code class="filename">README.txt</code> 
        file, which describes the INI format.  At the time of their
        creation, the files contain default values for each of the
        supported Subversion options, mostly commented out and grouped
        with textual descriptions about how the values for the key
        affect Subversion's behavior.  To change a certain behavior,
        you need only to load the appropriate configuration file into
        a text editor, and to modify the desired option's value.  If at
        any time you wish to have the default configuration settings
        restored, you can simply remove (or rename) your configuration
        directory and then run some innocuous <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        command, such as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn --version</code></strong>.  A new
        configuration directory with the default contents will be
        created.</p>
<p>The per-user configuration area also contains a cache of
        authentication data.  The <code class="filename">auth</code> directory
        holds a set of subdirectories that contain pieces of cached
        information used by Subversion's various supported
        authentication methods.  This directory is created in such a
        way that only the user herself has permission to read its
        contents.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="de">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.confarea.windows-registry"></a>7.1.2. Configuration and the Windows Registry</h3></div></div></div>
<p>In addition to the usual INI-based configuration area,
        Subversion clients running on Windows platforms may also use
        the Windows Registry to hold the configuration data.  The
        option names and their values are the same as in the INI
        files.  The &#8222;<span class="quote">file/section</span>&#8220; hierarchy is
        preserved as well, though addressed in a slightly different
        fashion&#8212;in this schema, files and sections are just
        levels in the Registry key tree.</p>
<p>Subversion looks for system-wide configuration values
        under the
        <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</code>
        key.  For example, the <code class="literal">global-ignores</code> option,
        which is in the <code class="literal">miscellany</code> section of the
        <code class="filename">config</code> file, would be found at
        <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</code>.
        Per-user configuration values should be stored under
        <code class="literal">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</code>.
      </p>
<p>Registry-based configuration options are parsed
        <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> their file-based counterparts, so
        they are overridden by values found in the configuration files.  In
        other words, Subversion looks for configuration information in
        the following locations on a Windows system; lower-numbered
        locations take precedence over higher-numbered locations:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>Command-line options</p></li>
<li><p>The per-user INI files</p></li>
<li><p>The per-user Registry values</p></li>
<li><p>The system-wide INI files</p></li>
<li><p>The system-wide Registry values</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Also, the Windows Registry doesn't really support the
        notion of something being &#8222;<span class="quote">commented out.</span>&#8220;
        However, Subversion will ignore any option key whose name
        begins with a hash (<code class="literal">#</code>) character.  This
        allows you to effectively comment out a Subversion option
        without deleting the entire key from the Registry, obviously
        simplifying the process of restoring that option.</p>
<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> command-line client never
        attempts to write to the Windows Registry and will not attempt
        to create a default configuration area there.  You can create
        the keys you need using the <span class="command"><strong>REGEDIT</strong></span>
        program.  Alternatively, you can create a
        <code class="filename">.reg</code> file (such as the one in <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.windows-registry.ex-1" title="Beispiel 7.1. Sample registration entries (.reg) file">Beispiel 7.1, &#8222;Sample registration entries (.reg) file&#8220;</a>), and
        then double-click on that file's icon in the Explorer shell,
        which will cause the data to be merged into your
        Registry.</p>

          section is essentially a cross-reference table.  The keys in
          this section are the names of other sections in the file;
          their values are <em class="firstterm">globs</em>&#8212;textual

<p>When Subversion is used over a network, it attempts to
          match the name of the server it is trying to reach with a
          group name under the <code class="literal">groups</code> section.  If
          a match is made, Subversion then looks for a section in the
          <code class="filename">servers</code> file whose name is the matched
          group's name.  From that section, it reads the actual network
          configuration settings.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">global</code> section contains the
          settings that are meant for all of the servers not matched
          by one of the globs under the <code class="literal">groups</code>
          section.  The options available in this section are
          exactly the same as those that are valid for the other server
          sections in the file (except, of course, the special
          <code class="literal">groups</code> section), and are as
          follows:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">http-proxy-exceptions</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies a comma-separated list of patterns
                for repository hostnames that should be accessed
                directly, without using the proxy machine.  The
                pattern syntax is the same as is used in the Unix
                shell for filenames.  A repository hostname matching
                any of these patterns will not be proxied.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">http-proxy-host</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies the hostname of the proxy computer
                through which your HTTP-based Subversion requests must
                pass.  It defaults to an empty value, which means that
                Subversion will not attempt to route HTTP requests
                through a proxy computer, and will instead attempt to
                contact the destination machine directly.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">http-proxy-port</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies the port number on the proxy host
                to use.  It defaults to an empty value.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">http-proxy-username</code></span></dt>

                machine.  It defaults to an empty value.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">http-proxy-password</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies the password to supply to the proxy

                Subversion operations to time out, you should increase
                the value of this option.  The default value is
                <code class="literal">0</code>, which instructs the underlying
                HTTP library, Neon, to use its default timeout

                (though compression will occur only if that capability
                is compiled into the network layer).  Set this to

<p>Subversion provides a pair of repository access
                modules that understand its WebDAV network protocol.
                The original one, which shipped with Subversion 1.0, is
                <code class="literal">libsvn_ra_neon</code> (though back then it
                was called <code class="literal">libsvn_ra_dav</code>).  Newer
                Subversion versions also provide
                <code class="literal">libsvn_ra_serf</code>, which uses a
                different underlying implementation and aims to
                support some of the newer HTTP concepts.</p>
<p>At this point, <code class="literal">libsvn_ra_serf</code>
                is still considered experimental, though it appears to
                work in the common cases quite well.  To encourage
                experimentation, Subversion provides the
                <code class="literal">http-library</code> runtime configuration
                option to allow users to specify (generally, or in a
                per-server-group fashion) which WebDAV access module
                they'd prefer to use&#8212;<code class="literal">neon</code> or

<p>Normally your working copy files have timestamps

                <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommand.  This is generally
                convenient for people developing software, because

                deciding which files need to be recompiled.</p>
<p>In other situations, however, it's sometimes nice
                for the working copy files to have timestamps that

<dd>
<p>The value of this option is a space-delimited list
                of file extensions that Subversion should preserve
                when generating conflict filenames.  By default, the
                list is empty.  This option is new to Subversion
                1.5.</p>
<p>When Subversion detects conflicting file content
                changes, it defers resolution of those conflicts to the
                user.  To assist in the resolution, Subversion keeps
                pristine copies of the various competing versions of
                the file in the working copy.  By default, those
                conflict files have names constructed by appending to
                the original filename a custom extension such as
                <code class="filename">.mine</code> or
                <code class="filename">.<em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em></code>
                (where <em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em> is a revision
                number).  A mild annoyance with this naming scheme is
                that on operating systems where a file's extension
                determines the default application used to open and
                edit that file, appending a custom extension prevents
                the file from being easily opened by its native
                application.  For example, if the file
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf</code> was conflicted,
                the conflict files might be named
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine</code> or
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231</code>.  While
                your system might be configured to use Adobe's Acrobat
                Reader to open files whose extensions are
                <code class="filename">.pdf</code>, there probably isn't an
                application configured on your system to open all
                files whose extensions are
                <code class="filename">.r4231</code>.</p>
<p>You can fix this annoyance by using this
                configuration option, though.  For files with one of
                the specified extensions, Subversion will append to
                the conflict file names the custom extension just as
                before, but then also reappend the file's original
                extension.  Using the previous example, and assuming
                that <code class="literal">pdf</code> is one of the extensions
                configured in this list thereof, the conflict files
                generated for <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf</code>
                would instead be named
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine.pdf</code> and
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231.pdf</code>.
                Because each file ends in
                <code class="filename">.pdf</code>, the correct default
                application will be used to view them.</p>

          pattern that matches one or more filenames and the rest of
          the line is a semicolon-delimited set of property
          assignments.  Multiple matches
          on a file will result in multiple propsets for that
          file; however, there is no guarantee that auto-props
          will be applied in the order in which they are listed
          in the config file, so you can't have one rule
          &#8222;<span class="quote">override</span>&#8220; another.  You can find several
          examples of auto-props usage in the

<p><em class="firstterm">Localization</em> is the act of making
      programs behave in a region-specific way.  When a program
      formats numbers or dates in a way specific to your part of the
      world or prints messages (or accepts input) in your native
      language, the program is said to
      be <em class="firstterm">localized</em>.  This section describes

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.l10n.understanding"></a>7.2.1. Understanding Locales</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Most modern operating systems have a notion of the
        &#8222;<span class="quote">current locale</span>&#8220;&#8212;that is, the region or
        country whose localization conventions are honored.  These
        conventions&#8212;typically chosen by some runtime
        configuration mechanism on the computer&#8212;affect the way
        in which programs present data to the user, as well as the way
        in which they accept user input.</p>
<p>On most Unix-like systems, you can check the values of the
        locale-related runtime configuration options by running the
        <span class="command"><strong>locale</strong></span> command:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ locale
LANG=
LC_COLLATE="C"
LC_CTYPE="C"
LC_MESSAGES="C"
LC_MONETARY="C"
LC_NUMERIC="C"
LC_TIME="C"
LC_ALL="C"
$
</pre>
<p>The output is a list of locale-related environment
        variables and their current values.  In this example, the
        variables are all set to the default <code class="literal">C</code>
        locale, but users can set these variables to specific
        country/language code combinations.  For example, if one were
        to set the <code class="literal">LC_TIME</code> variable to
        <code class="literal">fr_CA</code>, programs would know to present
        time and date information formatted according to a
        French-speaking Canadian's expectations.  And if one were to
        set the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable to
        <code class="literal">zh_TW</code>, programs would know to present
        human-readable messages in Traditional Chinese.  Setting the
        <code class="literal">LC_ALL</code> variable has the effect of changing
        every locale variable to the same value.  The value of
        <code class="literal">LANG</code> is used as a default value for any
        locale variable that is unset.  To see the list of available
        locales on a Unix system, run the command <strong class="userinput"><code>locale
        -a</code></strong>.</p>
<p>On Windows, locale configuration is done via the
        &#8222;<span class="quote">Regional and Language Options</span>&#8220; control panel
        item.  There you can view and select the values of individual
        settings from the available locales, and even customize (at a

<a name="svn.advanced.l10n.svnuse"></a>7.2.2. Subversion's Use of Locales</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The Subversion client, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>, honors the
        current locale configuration in two ways.  First, it notices
        the value of the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable and
        attempts to print all messages in the specified language.  For
        example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE
$ svn help cat
cat: Gibt den Inhalt der angegebenen Dateien oder URLs aus.
Aufruf: cat ZIEL[@REV]...
&#8230;
</pre>
<p>This behavior works identically on both Unix and Windows
        systems.  Note, though, that while your operating system might
        have support for a certain locale, the Subversion client still
        may not be able to speak the particular language.  In order to
        produce localized messages, human volunteers must provide
        translations for each language.  The translations are written
        using the GNU gettext package, which results in translation
        modules that end with the <code class="filename">.mo</code> filename
        extension.  For example, the German translation file is named
        <code class="filename">de.mo</code>.  These translation files are
        installed somewhere on your system.  On Unix, they typically
        live in <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/</code>, while
        on Windows they're often found in the
        <code class="filename">share\locale\</code> folder in Subversion's
        installation area.  Once installed, a module is named after
        the program for which it provides translations.  For example, the
        <code class="filename">de.mo</code> file may ultimately end up
        installed as
        <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo</code>.
        By browsing the installed <code class="filename">.mo</code> files, you
        can see which languages the Subversion client is able to
        speak.</p>
<p>The second way in which the locale is honored involves how
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> interprets your input.  The repository
        stores all paths, filenames, and log messages in Unicode,
        encoded as UTF-8.  In that sense, the repository is
        <em class="firstterm">internationalized</em>&#8212;that is, the
        repository is ready to accept input in any human language.
        This means, however, that the Subversion client is responsible
        for sending only UTF-8 filenames and log messages into the
        repository.  To do this, it must convert the data
        from the native locale into UTF-8.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you create a file named
        <code class="filename">caffè.txt</code>, and then when committing the
        file, you write the log message as &#8222;<span class="quote">Adesso il caffè è
        più forte.</span>&#8220;  Both the filename and the log message contain
        non-ASCII characters, but because your locale is set to
        <code class="literal">it_IT</code>, the Subversion client knows to
        interpret them as Italian.  It uses an Italian character set
        to convert the data to UTF-8 before sending it off to the
        repository.</p>
<p>Note that while the repository demands UTF-8 filenames and
        log messages, it <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span> pay attention
        to file contents.  Subversion treats file contents as opaque
        strings of bytes, and neither client nor server makes an
        attempt to understand the character set or encoding of the
        contents.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Character Set Conversion Errors</b></p>
<p>While using Subversion, you might get hit with an error
          related to character set conversions:</p>
<pre class="screen">
svn: Can't convert string from native encoding to 'UTF-8':
&#8230;
svn: Can't convert string from 'UTF-8' to native encoding:
&#8230;
</pre>
<p>Errors such as this typically occur when the Subversion
          client has received a UTF-8 string from the repository, but
          not all of the characters in that string can be represented
          using the encoding of the current locale.  For example, if
          your locale is <code class="literal">en_US</code> but a collaborator
          has committed a Japanese filename, you're likely to see this
          error when you receive the file during an <span class="command"><strong>svn
          update</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The solution is either to set your locale to something
          that <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> represent the incoming UTF-8
          data, or to change the filename or log message in the
          repository.  (And don't forget to slap your collaborator's
          hand&#8212;projects should decide on common languages ahead of
          time so that all participants are using the same
          locale.)</p>

<a name="svn.advanced.externaleditors"></a>7.3. Using External Editors</h2></div></div></div>
<p>The most obvious way to get data into Subversion is through
      the addition of files to version control, committing changes to
      those files, and so on.  But other pieces of
      information besides merely versioned file data live in your
      Subversion repository.  Some of these bits of
      information&#8212;commit log messages, lock comments, and some
      property values&#8212;tend to be textual in nature and are
      provided explicitly by users.  Most of this information can be
      provided to the Subversion command-line client using the
      <code class="option">--message</code> (<code class="option">-m</code>) and
      <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) options with the
      appropriate subcommands.</p>
<p>Each of these options has its pros and cons.  For example,
      when performing a commit, <code class="option">--file</code>
      (<code class="option">-F</code>) works well if you've already prepared a
      text file that holds your commit log message.  If you didn't,
      though, you can use <code class="option">--message</code>
      (<code class="option">-m</code>) to provide a log message on the command
      line.  Unfortunately, it can be tricky to compose anything more
      than a simple one-line message on the command line.  Users want
      more flexibility&#8212;multiline, free-form log message editing
      on demand.</p>
<p>Subversion supports this by allowing you to specify an
      external text editor that it will launch as necessary
      to give you a more powerful input mechanism for this textual
      metadata.  There are several ways to tell Subversion which
      editor you'd like use.  Subversion checks the following things,
      in the order specified, when it wants to launch such an
      editor:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p><code class="literal">--editor-cmd</code> command-line option</p></li>
<li><p><code class="literal">SVN_EDITOR</code> environment variable</p></li>
<li><p><code class="literal">editor-cmd</code> runtime configuration option</p></li>
<li><p><code class="literal">VISUAL</code> environment variable</p></li>
<li><p><code class="literal">EDITOR</code> environment variable</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly, a fallback value built into the Subversion
          libraries (not present in the official builds)</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>The value of any of these options or variables is the
      beginning of a command line to be executed by the shell.
      Subversion appends to that command line a space and the pathname
      of a temporary file to be edited.  So, to be used with
      Subversion, the configured or specified editor needs to support
      an invocation in which its last command-line parameter is a file
      to be edited, and it should be able to save the file in place
      and return a zero exit code to indicate success.</p>
<p>As noted, external editors can be used to provide commit log
      messages to any of the committing subcommands (such as
      <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>import</strong></span>,
      <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>delete</strong></span> when
      provided a URL target, etc.), and Subversion will try to
      launch the editor automatically if you don't specify either of
      the <code class="option">--message</code> (<code class="option">-m</code>) or
      <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) options.  The
      <span class="command"><strong>svn propedit</strong></span> command is built almost entirely
      around the use of an external editor.  And beginning in version
      1.5, Subversion will also use the configured external text
      editor when the user asks it to launch an editor during
      interactive conflict resolution.  Oddly, there doesn't appear to
      be a way to use external editors to interactively provide lock
      comments.</p>

<a name="svn.advanced.externaldifftools"></a>7.4. Using External Differencing and Merge Tools</h2></div></div></div>
<p>The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way
      differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only
      contextual differencing capabilities were built around
      invocations of the GNU diffutils toolchain, specifically the
      <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>diff3</strong></span> utilities.
      To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it called these
      utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters,
      most of which were quite specific to the utilities.  Some time
      later, Subversion grew its own internal differencing library,
      and as a failover mechanism, the <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and
      <code class="option">--diff3-cmd</code> options were added to the
      Subversion command-line client so that users could more easily
      indicate that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3
      utilities instead of the newfangled internal diff library.  If
      those options were used, Subversion would simply ignore the
      internal diff library, and fall back to running those external
      programs, lengthy argument lists and all.  And that's where
      things remain today.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for folks to realize that having such
      easy configuration mechanisms for specifying that Subversion
      should use the external GNU diff and diff3 utilities located at
      a particular place on the system could be applied toward the use
      of other differencing tools, too.  After all, Subversion didn't
      actually verify that the things it was being told to run were
      members of the GNU diffutils toolchain.  But the only
      configurable aspect of using those external tools is their
      location on the system&#8212;not the option set, parameter
      order, and so on.  Subversion continues to throw all those GNU utility
      options at your external diff tool regardless of whether
      that program can understand those options.  And that's where
      things get unintuitive for most users.</p>
<p>The key to using external two- and three-way differencing tools
      (other than GNU diff and diff3, of course) with Subversion is to
      use wrapper scripts, which convert the input from Subversion into
      something that your differencing tool can understand, and then
      to convert the output of your tool back into a format that
      Subversion expects&#8212;the format that the GNU tools would
      have used.  The following sections cover the specifics of those
      expectations.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">

</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The decision on when to fire off a contextual two- or three-way
        diff as part of a larger Subversion operation is made entirely
        by Subversion and is affected by, among other things, whether
        the files being operated on are human-readable as
        determined by their <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property.
        This means, for example, that even if you had the niftiest
        Microsoft Word-aware differencing or merging tool in the
        universe, it would never be invoked by Subversion as long as
        your versioned Word documents had a configured MIME type that
        denoted that they were not human-readable (such as
        <code class="literal">application/msword</code>).  For more about MIME
        type settings, see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. File Content Type">Abschnitt 3.3.1, &#8222;File Content Type&#8220;</a></p></td></tr>

<p>Subversion 1.5 introduces interactive resolution of
      conflicts (described in <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="2.4.5. Konflikte auflösen (Änderungen anderer einarbeiten)">Abschnitt 2.4.5, &#8222;Konflikte auflösen (Änderungen anderer einarbeiten)&#8220;</a>), and one of the options provided to users is the ability to
      launch a third-party merge tool.  If this action is taken,
      Subversion will consult the <code class="literal">merge-tool-cmd</code>
      runtime configuration option to find the name of an external
      merge tool and, upon finding one, will launch that tool with the
      appropriate input files.  This differs from the configurable
      three-way differencing tool in a couple of ways.  First, the
      differencing tool is always used to handle three-way
      differences, whereas the merge tool is employed only when
      three-way difference application has detected a conflict.
      Second, the interface is much cleaner&#8212;your configured
      merge tool need only accept as command-line parameters four path
      specifications:  the base file, the &#8222;<span class="quote">theirs</span>&#8220; file
      (which contains upstream changes), the &#8222;<span class="quote">mine</span>&#8220; file
      (which contains local modifications), and the path of the file
      where the final resolved contents should be stored.</p>

<p>Subversion calls external diff programs with parameters
        suitable for the GNU diff utility, and expects only that the
        external program will return with a successful error code.  For
        most alternative diff programs, only the sixth and seventh
        arguments&#8212;the paths of the files that represent the left and
        right sides of the diff, respectively&#8212;are of interest.  Note
        that Subversion runs the diff program once per modified file
        covered by the Subversion operation, so if your program runs
        in an asynchronous fashion (or is &#8222;<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>&#8220;),
        you might have several instances of it all running
        simultaneously.  Finally, Subversion expects that your program
        return an error code of 1 if your program detected differences,
        or 0 if it did not&#8212;any other error code is considered a
        fatal error.

<p>Sometimes there's a single right way to do things; sometimes
      there are many.  Subversion's developers understand that while
      the majority of its exact behaviors are acceptable to most of
      its users, there are some corners of its functionality where
      such a universally pleasing approach doesn't exist.  In those
      places, Subversion offers users the opportunity to tell it how
      <span class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> want it to behave.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we explored Subversion's runtime
      configuration system and other mechanisms by which users can
      control those configurable behaviors.  If you are a developer,
      though, the next chapter will take you one step further.  It
      describes how you can further customize your Subversion
      experience by writing your own software against Subversion's
