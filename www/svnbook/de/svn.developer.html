<p>Subversion has a modular design: it's implemented as a
    collection of libraries written in C.  Each library has a
    well-defined purpose and application programming interface (API),
    and that interface is available not only for Subversion itself to
    use, but for any software that wishes to embed or otherwise
    programmatically control Subversion.  Additionally, Subversion's
    API is available not only to other C programs, but also to
    programs written in higher-level languages such as Python, Perl,
    Java, and Ruby.</p>
<p>This chapter is for those who wish to interact with Subversion
    through its public API or its various language bindings.  If you
    wish to write robust wrapper scripts around Subversion
    functionality to simplify your own life, are trying to develop
    more complex integrations between Subversion and other pieces of
    software, or just have an interest in Subversion's various library
    modules and what they offer, this chapter is for you.  If,
    however, you don't foresee yourself participating with Subversion
    at such a level, feel free to skip this chapter with the
    confidence that your experience as a Subversion user will not be
    affected.</p>

<a name="svn.developer.layerlib"></a>8.1. Layered Library Design</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Each of Subversion's core libraries can be said to exist in
      one of three main layers&#8212;the Repository layer, the
      Repository Access (RA) layer, or the Client layer (see <a class="xref" href="svn.preface.html#svn.intro.architecture.dia-1" title="Abbildung 1. Die Architektur von Subversion">Abbildung 1, &#8222;Die Architektur von Subversion&#8220;</a> in the Preface).  We will examine
      these layers shortly, but first, let's briefly summarize
      Subversion's various libraries.  For the sake of consistency, we
      will refer to the libraries by their extensionless Unix library
      names (<code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code>, <code class="filename">libsvn_wc</code>,
      <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>The fact that the word &#8222;<span class="quote">miscellaneous</span>&#8220;
      appears only once in the previous list is a good sign.  The
      Subversion development team is serious about making sure that
      functionality lives in the right layer and libraries.  Perhaps
      the greatest advantage of the modular design is its lack of
      complexity from a developer's point of view.  As a developer,
      you can quickly formulate that kind of &#8222;<span class="quote">big
      picture</span>&#8220; that allows you to pinpoint the location of
      certain pieces of functionality with relative ease.</p>
<p>Another benefit of modularity is the ability to replace a
      given module with a whole new library that implements the same
      API without affecting the rest of the code base.  In some sense,
      this happens within Subversion already.  The
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code>,
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_neon</code>,
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_serf</code>, and
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code> libraries each implement the
      same interface, all working as plug-ins to
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra</code>.  And all four communicate with
      the Repository layer&#8212;<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code> connects to the
      repository directly; the other three do so over a network.  The
      <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code> and
      <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_fs</code> libraries are another pair of
      libraries that implement the same functionality in different
      ways&#8212;both are plug-ins to the common
      <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> library.</p>
<p>The client itself also highlights the benefits of modularity
      in the Subversion design.  Subversion's
      <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> library is a one-stop shop
      for most of the functionality necessary for designing a working
      Subversion client (see <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.layerlib.client" title="8.1.3. Client Layer">Abschnitt 8.1.3, &#8222;Client Layer&#8220;</a>).  So while the
      Subversion distribution provides only the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
      command-line client program, several third-party
      programs provide various forms of graphical client UIs.
      These GUIs use the same APIs that the stock command-line client
      does.  This type of modularity has played a large role in the
      proliferation of available Subversion clients and IDE
      integrations and, by extension, to the tremendous adoption rate
      of Subversion itself.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="de">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.developer.layerlib.repos"></a>8.1.1. Repository Layer</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When referring to Subversion's Repository layer, we're
        generally talking about two basic concepts&#8212;the versioned
        filesystem implementation (accessed via
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code>, and supported by its
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code> and
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_fs</code> plug-ins), and the repository
        logic that wraps it (as implemented in
        <code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>).  These libraries provide
        the storage and reporting mechanisms for the various revisions
        of your version-controlled data.  This layer is connected to
        the Client layer via the Repository Access layer, and is, from
        the perspective of the Subversion user, the stuff at the
        &#8222;<span class="quote">other end of the line.</span>&#8220;</p>
<p>The Subversion filesystem is not a kernel-level filesystem
        that one would install in an operating system (such as the
        Linux ext2 or NTFS), but instead is a virtual filesystem.
        Rather than storing &#8222;<span class="quote">files</span>&#8220; and
        &#8222;<span class="quote">directories</span>&#8220; as real files and directories (the
        kind you can navigate through using your favorite shell
        program), it uses one of two available abstract storage
        backends&#8212;either a Berkeley DB database environment or a
        flat-file representation.  (To learn more about the two
        repository backends, see <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.html#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends" title="5.2.3. Auswahl der Datenspeicherung">Abschnitt 5.2.3, &#8222;Auswahl der Datenspeicherung&#8220;</a>.)  There has even
        been considerable interest by the development community in
        giving future releases of Subversion the ability to use other
        backend database systems, perhaps through a mechanism such as
        Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).  In fact, Google did
        something similar to this before launching the Google Code
        Project Hosting service:  they announced in mid-2006 that
        members of its open source team had written a new proprietary
        Subversion filesystem plug-in that used Google's ultra-scalable
        Bigtable database for its storage.</p>
<p>The filesystem API exported by
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> contains the kinds of
        functionality you would expect from any other filesystem
        API&#8212;you can create and remove files and directories,
        copy and move them around, modify file contents, and so on.
        It also has features that are not quite as common, such as the
        ability to add, modify, and remove metadata
        (&#8222;<span class="quote">properties</span>&#8220;) on each file or directory.
        Furthermore, the Subversion filesystem is a versioning
        filesystem, which means that as you make changes to your
        directory tree, Subversion remembers what your tree looked
        like before those changes.  And before the previous changes.
        And the previous ones.  And so on, all the way back through
        versioning time to (and just beyond) the moment you first
        started adding things to the filesystem.</p>
<p>All the modifications you make to your tree are done
        within the context of a Subversion commit transaction.  The
        following is a simplified general routine for modifying your
        filesystem:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>Begin a Subversion commit transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Make your changes (adds, deletes, property
            modifications, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Commit your transaction.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Once you have committed your transaction, your filesystem
        modifications are permanently stored as historical artifacts.
        Each of these cycles generates a single new revision of your
        tree, and each revision is forever accessible as an immutable
        snapshot of &#8222;<span class="quote">the way things were.</span>&#8220;</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>The Transaction Distraction</b></p>
<p>The notion of a Subversion transaction can become easily
          confused with the transaction support provided by the
          underlying database itself, especially given the former's
          close proximity to the Berkeley DB database code in
          <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code>.  Both types of
          transaction exist to provide atomicity and isolation.  In
          other words, transactions give you the ability to perform a
          set of actions in an all-or-nothing fashion&#8212;either all
          the actions in the set complete with success, or they all
          get treated as though <span class="emphasis"><em>none</em></span> of them ever
          happened&#8212;and in a way that does not interfere with
          other processes acting on the data.</p>
<p>Database transactions generally encompass small
          operations related specifically to the modification of data
          in the database itself (such as changing the contents of a
          table row).  Subversion transactions are larger in scope,
          encompassing higher-level operations such as making
          modifications to a set of files and directories that are
          intended to be stored as the next revision of the filesystem
          tree.  If that isn't confusing enough, consider the fact
          that Subversion uses a database transaction during the
          creation of a Subversion transaction (so that if the
          creation of a Subversion transaction fails, the database will
          look as though we had never attempted that creation in the first
          place)!</p>
<p>Fortunately for users of the filesystem API, the
          transaction support provided by the database system itself
          is hidden almost entirely from view (as should be expected
          from a properly modularized library scheme).  It is only
          when you start digging into the implementation of the
          filesystem itself that such things become visible (or
          interesting).</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the functionality the filesystem
        interface provides deals with actions that occur on individual
        filesystem paths.  That is, from outside the filesystem, the
        primary mechanism for describing and accessing the individual
        revisions of files and directories comes through the use of
        path strings such as <code class="filename">/foo/bar</code>, just as though
        you were addressing files and directories through your
        favorite shell program.  You add new files and directories by
        passing their paths-to-be to the right API functions.  You
        query for information about them by the same mechanism.</p>
<p>Unlike most filesystems, though, a path alone is not
        enough information to identify a file or directory in
        Subversion.  Think of a directory tree as a two-dimensional
        system, where a node's siblings represent a sort of
        left-and-right motion, and navigating into the node's
        subdirectories represents a downward motion.  <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.layerlib.repos.dia-1" title="Abbildung 8.1. Files and directories in two dimensions">Abbildung 8.1, &#8222;Files and directories in two dimensions&#8220;</a> shows a typical
        representation of a tree as exactly that.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a name="svn.developer.layerlib.repos.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 8.1. Files and directories in two dimensions</b></p>
<div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch08dia1.png" alt="Files and directories in two dimensions"></div></div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>The difference here is that the Subversion filesystem has a
        nifty third dimension that most filesystems do not
        have&#8212;Time!
        <sup>[<a name="id410239" href="#ftn.id410239" class="footnote">51</a>]</sup>
        In the filesystem interface, nearly every function that has a
        <em class="parameter"><code>path</code></em> argument also expects a
        <em class="parameter"><code>root</code></em> argument.  This
        <code class="literal">svn_fs_root_t</code> argument describes
        either a revision or a Subversion transaction (which is simply
        a revision in the making) and provides that third dimension
        of context needed to understand the difference between
        <code class="filename">/foo/bar</code> in revision 32, and the same
        path as it exists in revision 98.  <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.layerlib.repos.dia-2" title="Abbildung 8.2. Versioning time&#8212;the third dimension!">Abbildung 8.2, &#8222;Versioning time&#8212;the third dimension!&#8220;</a> shows revision
        history as an added dimension to the Subversion filesystem
        universe.</p>

</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>As we mentioned earlier, the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> API looks and feels like any
        other filesystem, except that it has this wonderful versioning
        capability.  It was designed to be usable by any program
        interested in a versioning filesystem.  Not coincidentally,
        Subversion itself is interested in that functionality.  But
        while the filesystem API should be sufficient for basic file
        and directory versioning support, Subversion wants
        more&#8212;and that is where <code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>
        comes in.</p>
<p>The Subversion repository library
        (<code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>) sits (logically speaking)
        atop the <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> API, providing
        additional functionality beyond that of the underlying
        versioned filesystem logic.  It does not completely wrap each
        and every filesystem function&#8212;only certain major steps
        in the general cycle of filesystem activity are wrapped by the
        repository interface.  Some of these include the creation and
        commit of Subversion transactions and the modification of
        revision properties.  These particular events are wrapped by
        the repository layer because they have hooks associated with
        them.  A repository hook system is not strictly related to
        implementing a versioning filesystem, so it lives in the
        repository wrapper library.</p>
<p>The hooks mechanism is but one of the reasons for the
        abstraction of a separate repository library from the rest of
        the filesystem code.  The <code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>
        API provides several other important utilities to Subversion.
        These include the abilities to:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Create, open, destroy, and perform recovery steps on a
            Subversion repository and the filesystem included in that
            repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the differences between two filesystem
            trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Query for the commit log messages associated with all
            (or some) of the revisions in which a set of files was
            modified in the filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a human-readable &#8222;<span class="quote">dump</span>&#8220; of the
            filesystem&#8212;a complete representation of the revisions in
            the filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Parse that dump format, loading the dumped revisions
            into a different Subversion repository.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>As Subversion continues to evolve, the repository library
        will grow with the filesystem library to offer increased
        functionality and configurable option support.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="de">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.developer.layerlib.ra"></a>8.1.2. Repository Access Layer</h3></div></div></div>
<p>If the Subversion Repository layer is at &#8222;<span class="quote">the other
        end of the line,</span>&#8220; the Repository Access (RA) layer is
        the line itself.  Charged with marshaling data between the
        client libraries and the repository, this layer includes the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra</code> module loader library, the RA
        modules themselves (which currently includes
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_neon</code>,
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code>,
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_serf</code>, and
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code>), and any additional
        libraries needed by one or more of those RA modules (such as
        the <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code> Apache module or
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code>'s server,
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>).</p>
<p>Since Subversion uses URLs to identify its repository
        resources, the protocol portion of the URL scheme (usually
        <code class="literal">file://</code>, <code class="literal">http://</code>,
        <code class="literal">https://</code>, <code class="literal">svn://</code>, or
        <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>) is used to determine which RA
        module will handle the communications.  Each module registers
        a list of the protocols it knows how to &#8222;<span class="quote">speak</span>&#8220;
        so that the RA loader can, at runtime, determine which module
        to use for the task at hand.  You can determine which RA

Subversion is open source software, see http://subversion.tigris.org/
This product includes software developed by CollabNet (http://www.Collab.Net/).

The following repository access (RA) modules are available:

* ra_neon : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using Neon.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme
* ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network protocol.
  - handles 'svn' scheme
* ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.
  - handles 'file' scheme
* ra_serf : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using serf.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme

<p>The public API exported by the RA layer contains
        functionality necessary for sending and receiving versioned
        data to and from the repository.  And each of the available RA
        plug-ins is able to perform that task using a specific
        protocol&#8212;<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_dav</code> speaks
        HTTP/WebDAV (optionally using SSL encryption) with an Apache
        HTTP Server that is running the
        <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code> Subversion server module;
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code> speaks a custom network
        protocol with the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program; and so
        on.</p>
<p>For those who wish to access a Subversion repository
        using still another protocol, that is precisely why the
        Repository Access layer is modularized!  Developers can simply
        write a new library that implements the RA interface on one
        side and communicates with the repository on the other.  Your
        new library can use existing network protocols or you can
        invent your own.  You could use interprocess communication
        (IPC) calls, or&#8212;let's get crazy, shall we?&#8212;you
        could even implement an email-based protocol.  Subversion
        supplies the APIs; you supply the creativity.</p>

<a name="svn.developer.layerlib.client"></a>8.1.3. Client Layer</h3></div></div></div>
<p>On the client side, the Subversion working copy is where
        all the action takes place.  The bulk of functionality
        implemented by the client-side libraries exists for the sole
        purpose of managing working copies&#8212;directories full of
        files and other subdirectories that serve as a sort of local,
        editable &#8222;<span class="quote">reflection</span>&#8220; of one or more repository
        locations&#8212;and propagating changes to and from the
        Repository Access layer.</p>
<p>Subversion's working copy library,
        <code class="filename">libsvn_wc</code>, is directly responsible for
        managing the data in the working copies.  To accomplish this,
        the library stores administrative information about each
        working copy directory within a special subdirectory.  This
        subdirectory, named <code class="filename">.svn</code>, is present in
        each working copy directory and contains various other files
        and directories that record state and provide a private
        workspace for administrative action.  For those familiar with
        CVS, this <code class="filename">.svn</code> subdirectory is similar in
        purpose to the <code class="filename">CVS</code> administrative
        directories found in CVS working copies.  For more information
        about the <code class="filename">.svn</code> administrative area, see
        <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.insidewc" title="8.2. Inside the Working Copy Administration Area">Abschnitt 8.2, &#8222;Inside the Working Copy Administration Area&#8220;</a> later in this
        chapter.</p>
<p>The Subversion client library,
        <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code>, has the broadest
        responsibility; its job is to mingle the functionality of the
        working copy library with that of the Repository Access layer,
        and then to provide the highest-level API to any application
        that wishes to perform general revision control actions.  For
        example, the function
        <code class="function">svn_client_checkout()</code> takes a URL as an
        argument.  It passes this URL to the RA layer and opens an
        authenticated session with a particular repository.  It then
        asks the repository for a certain tree, and sends this tree
        into the working copy library, which then writes a full
        working copy to disk (<code class="filename">.svn</code> directories
        and all).</p>
<p>The client library is designed to be used by any
        application.  While the Subversion source code includes a
        standard command-line client, it should be very easy to write
        any number of GUI clients on top of the client library.  New
        GUIs (or any new client, really) for Subversion need not be
        clunky wrappers around the included command-line
        client&#8212;they have full access via the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> API to the same functionality,
        data, and callback mechanisms that the command-line client
        uses.  In fact, the Subversion source code tree contains a
        small C program (which you can find at
        <code class="filename">tools/examples/minimal_client.c</code>) that
        exemplifies how to wield the Subversion API to create a simple
        client program.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Binding Directly&#8212;A Word About Correctness</b></p>
<p>Why should your GUI program bind directly with a
          <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> instead of acting as a
          wrapper around a command-line program?  Besides simply being
          more efficient, it can be more correct as well.  A
          command-line program (such as the one supplied with
          Subversion) that binds to the client library needs to
          effectively translate feedback and requested data bits from
          C types to some form of human-readable output.  This type of
          translation can be lossy.  That is, the program may not
          display all of the information harvested from the API or may
          combine bits of information for compact
          representation.</p>
<p>If you wrap such a command-line program with yet another
          program, the second program has access only to
          already interpreted (and as we mentioned, likely incomplete)
          information, which it must <span class="emphasis"><em>again</em></span>
          translate into <span class="emphasis"><em>its</em></span> representation
          format.  With each layer of wrapping, the integrity of the
          original data is potentially tainted more and more, much
          like the result of making a copy of a copy (of a copy&#8230;)
          of a favorite audio or video cassette.</p>
<p>But the most compelling argument for binding directly to
          the APIs instead of wrapping other programs is that the
          Subversion project makes compatibility promises regarding
          its APIs.  Across minor versions of those APIs (such as
          between 1.3 and 1.4), no function's prototype will change.
          In other words, you aren't forced to update your program's
          source code simply because you've upgraded to a new version
          of Subversion.  Certain functions might be deprecated, but
          they still work, and this gives you a buffer of time to
          eventually embrace the newer APIs.  These kinds of
          compatibility promises do not exist for Subversion
          command-line program output, which is subject to change from
          release to release.</p>

<a name="svn.developer.insidewc"></a>8.2. Inside the Working Copy Administration Area</h2></div></div></div>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, each directory of a Subversion
      working copy contains a special subdirectory called
      <code class="filename">.svn</code> that houses administrative data about
      that working copy directory.  Subversion uses the information in
      <code class="filename">.svn</code> to keep track of things such as:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Which repository location(s) are represented by the
          files and subdirectories in the working copy
          directory</p></li>
<li><p>What revision of each of those files and directories is
          currently present in the working copy</p></li>
<li><p>Any user-defined properties that might be attached
          to those files and directories</p></li>
<li><p>Pristine (unedited) copies of the working copy
          files</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>The Subversion working copy administration area's layout and
      contents are considered implementation details not really
      intended for human consumption.  Developers are encouraged to
      use Subversion's public APIs, or the tools that Subversion
      provides, to access and manipulate the working copy data,
      instead of directly reading or modifying those files.  The file
      formats employed by the working copy library for its
      administrative data do change from time to time&#8212;a fact
      that the public APIs do a great job of hiding from the average
      user.  In this section, we expose some of these implementation
      details sheerly to appease your overwhelming curiosity.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.developer.insidewc.entries"></a>8.2.1. The Entries File</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Perhaps the single most important file in the
        <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory is the
        <code class="filename">entries</code> file.  It
        contains the bulk of the administrative
        information about the versioned items in a working copy
        directory.  This one file tracks the repository
        URLs, pristine revision, file checksums, pristine text and
        property timestamps, scheduling and conflict state
        information, last-known commit information (author, revision,
        timestamp), local copy history&#8212;practically everything
        that a Subversion client is interested in knowing about a
        versioned (or to-be-versioned) resource!</p>
<p>Folks familiar with CVS's administrative directories will
        have recognized at this point that Subversion's
        <code class="filename">.svn/entries</code> file serves the purposes of,
        among other things, CVS's <code class="filename">CVS/Entries</code>,
        <code class="filename">CVS/Root</code>, and
        <code class="filename">CVS/Repository</code> files combined.</p>
<p>The format of the <code class="filename">.svn/entries</code> file
        has changed over time.  Originally an XML file, it now uses a
        custom&#8212;though still human-readable&#8212;file format.
        While XML was a great choice for early developers of
        Subversion who were frequently debugging the file's contents
        (and Subversion's behavior in light of them), the need for
        easy developer debugging has diminished as Subversion has
        matured and has been replaced by the user's need for snappier
        performance.  Be aware that Subversion's working copy library
        automatically upgrades working copies from one format to
        another&#8212;it reads the old formats and writes the
        new&#8212;which saves you the hassle of checking out a new
        working copy, but can also complicate situations where
        different versions of Subversion might be trying to use the
        same working copy.</p>

<a name="svn.developer.insidewc.base-and-props"></a>8.2.2. Pristine Copies and Property Files</h3></div></div></div>
<p>As mentioned before, the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
        directory also holds the pristine &#8222;<span class="quote">text-base</span>&#8220;
        versions of files.  You can find those in
        <code class="filename">.svn/text-base</code>.  The benefits of these
        pristine copies are multiple&#8212;network-free checks for
        local modifications and difference reporting, network-free
        reversion of modified or missing files, more efficient
        transmission of changes to the server&#8212;but they come at the
        cost of having each versioned file stored at least twice on
        disk.  These days, this seems to be a negligible penalty for
        most files.  However, the situation gets uglier as the size of
        your versioned files grows.  Some attention is being given to
        making the presence of the &#8222;<span class="quote">text-base</span>&#8220; an option.
        Ironically, though, it is as your versioned files' sizes get
        larger that the existence of the &#8222;<span class="quote">text-base</span>&#8220;
        becomes more crucial&#8212;who wants to transmit a huge file
        across a network just because she wants to commit a tiny
        change to it?</p>
<p>Similar in purpose to the &#8222;<span class="quote">text-base</span>&#8220; files
        are the property files and their pristine
        &#8222;<span class="quote">prop-base</span>&#8220; copies, located in
        <code class="filename">.svn/props</code> and
        <code class="filename">.svn/prop-base</code>, respectively.  Since
        directories can have properties too, there are also
        <code class="filename">.svn/dir-props</code> and
        <code class="filename">.svn/dir-prop-base</code> files.</p>

<a name="svn.developer.usingapi"></a>8.3. Using the APIs</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Developing applications against the Subversion library APIs
      is fairly straightforward.  Subversion is primarily a set of C
      libraries, with header (<code class="filename">.h</code>) files that live
      in the <code class="filename">subversion/include</code> directory of the
      source tree.  These headers are copied into your system
      locations (e.g., <code class="filename">/usr/local/include</code>)
      when you build and install Subversion itself from source.  These
      headers represent the entirety of the functions and types meant
      to be accessible by users of the Subversion libraries.  The
      Subversion developer community is meticulous about ensuring that
      the public API is well documented&#8212;refer directly to the
      header files for that documentation.</p>
<p>When examining the public header files, the first thing you
      might notice is that Subversion's datatypes and functions are
      namespace-protected.  That is, every public Subversion symbol
      name begins with <code class="literal">svn_</code>, followed by a short
      code for the library in which the symbol is defined (such as
      <code class="literal">wc</code>, <code class="literal">client</code>,
      <code class="literal">fs</code>, etc.), followed by a single underscore
      (<code class="literal">_</code>), and then the rest of the symbol name.
      Semipublic functions (used among source files of a given
      library but not by code outside that library, and found inside
      the library directories themselves) differ from this naming
      scheme in that instead of a single underscore after the library
      code, they use a double underscore
      (<code class="literal">_&#8201;_</code>).  Functions that are private to
      a given source file have no special prefixing and are declared
      <code class="literal">static</code>.  Of course, a compiler isn't
      interested in these naming conventions, but they help to clarify
      the scope of a given function or datatype.</p>
<p>Another good source of information about programming against
      the Subversion APIs is the project's own hacking guidelines,
      which you can find at <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html</a>.  This
      document contains useful information, which, while aimed at
      developers and would-be developers of Subversion itself, is
      equally applicable to folks developing against Subversion as a
      set of third-party libraries.

<a name="svn.developer.usingapi.apr"></a>8.3.1. The Apache Portable Runtime Library</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Along with Subversion's own datatypes, you will see many
        references to datatypes that begin with
        <code class="literal">apr_</code>&#8212;symbols from the Apache Portable
        Runtime (APR) library.  APR is Apache's portability library,
        originally carved out of its server code as an attempt to
        separate the OS-specific bits from the OS-independent portions
        of the code.  The result was a library that provides a generic
        API for performing operations that differ mildly&#8212;or
        wildly&#8212;from OS to OS.  While the Apache HTTP Server was
        obviously the first user of the APR library, the Subversion
        developers immediately recognized the value of using APR as
        well.  This means that there is practically no OS-specific
        code in Subversion itself.  Also, it means that the Subversion
        client compiles and runs anywhere that the Apache HTTP Server
        does.  Currently, this list includes all flavors of Unix,
        Win32, BeOS, OS/2, and Mac OS X.</p>
<p>In addition to providing consistent implementations of
        system calls that differ across operating systems,
        <sup>[<a name="id411196" href="#ftn.id411196" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup>
        APR gives Subversion immediate access to many custom
        datatypes, such as dynamic arrays and hash tables.  Subversion
        uses these types extensively.  But
        perhaps the most pervasive APR datatype, found in nearly every
        Subversion API prototype, is the
        <code class="literal">apr_pool_t</code>&#8212;the APR memory pool.
        Subversion uses pools internally for all its memory allocation
        needs (unless an external library requires a different memory
        management mechanism for data passed through its API),
        <sup>[<a name="id411216" href="#ftn.id411216" class="footnote">54</a>]</sup>
        and while a person coding against the Subversion APIs is not
        required to do the same, she <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
        required to provide pools to the API functions that need them.
        This means that users of the Subversion API must also link
        against APR, must call <code class="function">apr_initialize()</code>
        to initialize the APR subsystem, and then must create and
        manage pools for use with Subversion API calls, typically by
        using <code class="function">svn_pool_create()</code>,
        <code class="function">svn_pool_clear()</code>, and
        <code class="function">svn_pool_destroy()</code>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Programming with Memory Pools</b></p>
<p>Almost every developer who has used the C programming
          language has at some point sighed at the daunting task of
          managing memory usage.  Allocating enough memory to use,
          keeping track of those allocations, freeing the memory when
          you no longer need it&#8212;these tasks can be quite
          complex.  And of course, failure to do those things properly
          can result in a program that crashes itself, or worse,
          crashes the computer.</p>
<p>Higher-level languages, on the other hand, either take
          the job of memory management away from you completely or
          make it something you toy with only when doing extremely
          tight program optimization.  Languages such as Java and
          Python use <em class="firstterm">garbage collection</em>,
          allocating memory for objects when needed, and automatically
          freeing that memory when the object is no longer in
          use.</p>
<p>APR provides a middle-ground approach called
          <em class="firstterm">pool-based memory management</em>.  It
          allows the developer to control memory usage at a lower
          resolution&#8212;per chunk (or &#8222;<span class="quote">pool</span>&#8220;) of
          memory, instead of per allocated object.  Rather than using
          <code class="function">malloc()</code> and friends to allocate enough
          memory for a given object, you ask APR to allocate the
          memory from a memory pool.  When you're finished using the
          objects you've created in the pool, you destroy the entire
          pool, effectively de-allocating the memory consumed by
          <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the objects you allocated from it.
          Thus, rather than keeping track of individual objects that
          need to be de-allocated, your program simply considers the
          general lifetimes of those objects and allocates the objects
          in a pool whose lifetime (the time between the pool's
          creation and its deletion) matches the object's
          needs.</p>

<a name="svn.developer.usingapi.urlpath"></a>8.3.2. URL and Path Requirements</h3></div></div></div>
<p>With remote version control operation as the whole point
        of Subversion's existence, it makes sense that some attention
        has been paid to internationalization (i18n) support.  After
        all, while &#8222;<span class="quote">remote</span>&#8220; might mean &#8222;<span class="quote">across the
        office,</span>&#8220; it could just as well mean &#8222;<span class="quote">across the
        globe.</span>&#8220; To facilitate this, all of Subversion's public
        interfaces that accept path arguments expect those paths to be
        canonicalized&#8212;which is most easily accomplished by passing
        them through the <code class="function">svn_path_canonicalize()</code>
        function&#8212;and encoded in UTF-8.  This means, for example, that
        any new client binary that drives the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> interface needs to first
        convert paths from the locale-specific encoding to UTF-8
        before passing those paths to the Subversion libraries, and
        then reconvert any resultant output paths from Subversion
        back into the locale's encoding before using those paths for
        non-Subversion purposes.  Fortunately, Subversion provides a
        suite of functions (see
        <code class="filename">subversion/include/svn_utf.h</code>) that 
        any program can use to do these conversions.</p>
<p>Also, Subversion APIs require all URL parameters to be
        properly URI-encoded.  So, instead of passing
        <code class="uri">file:///home/username/My File.txt</code> as the URL of a
        file named <code class="filename">My File.txt</code>, you need to pass
        <code class="uri">file:///home/username/My%20File.txt</code>.  Again,
        Subversion supplies helper functions that your application can
        use&#8212;<code class="function">svn_path_uri_encode()</code> and
        <code class="function">svn_path_uri_decode()</code>, for URI encoding
        and decoding, respectively.</p>

<a name="svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs"></a>8.3.3. Using Languages Other Than C and C++</h3></div></div></div>
<p>If you are interested in using the Subversion libraries in
        conjunction with something other than a C program&#8212;say, a
        Python or Perl script&#8212;Subversion has some support for this
        via the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG).  The
        SWIG bindings for Subversion are located in
        <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/swig</code>.  They are still
        maturing, but they are usable.  These bindings allow you
        to call Subversion API functions indirectly, using wrappers that
        translate the datatypes native to your scripting language into
        the datatypes needed by Subversion's C libraries.</p>
<p>Significant efforts have been made toward creating
        functional SWIG-generated bindings for Python, Perl, and Ruby.
        To some extent, the work done preparing the SWIG interface
        files for these languages is reusable in efforts to generate
        bindings for other languages supported by SWIG (which include
        versions of C#, Guile, Java, MzScheme, OCaml, PHP, and Tcl,
        among others).  However, some extra programming is required to
        compensate for complex APIs that SWIG needs some help
        translating between languages.  For more information on SWIG
        itself, see the project's web site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.swig.org/" target="_top">http://www.swig.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Subversion also has language bindings for Java.  The
        javahl bindings (located in
        <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/java</code> in the
        Subversion source tree) aren't SWIG-based, but are instead a
        mixture of Java and hand-coded JNI.  Javahl covers most
        Subversion client-side APIs and is specifically targeted at
        implementors of Java-based Subversion clients and IDE
        integrations.</p>
<p>Subversion's language bindings tend to lack the level of
        developer attention given to the core Subversion modules, but
        can generally be trusted as production-ready.  A number of
        scripts and applications, alternative Subversion GUI clients,
        and other third-party tools are successfully using
        Subversion's language bindings today to accomplish their
        Subversion integrations.</p>
<p>It's worth noting here that there are other options for
        interfacing with Subversion using other languages:  alternative
        bindings for Subversion that aren't provided by the
        Subversion development community at all.  You can find links
        to these alternative bindings on the Subversion project's
        links page (at <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html</a>), but there
        are a couple of popular ones we feel are especially
        noteworthy.  First, Barry Scott's PySVN bindings (<a class="ulink" href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://pysvn.tigris.org/</a>) are a popular option for
        binding with Python.  PySVN boasts of a more Pythonic
        interface than the more C-like APIs provided by Subversion's
        own Python bindings.  And if you're looking for a pure Java
        implementation of Subversion, check out SVNKit (<a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>), which is Subversion rewritten
        from the ground up in Java.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>SVNKit Versus javahl</b></p>
<p>In 2005, a small company called TMate announced the
          1.0.0 release of JavaSVN&#8212;a pure Java implementation of
          Subversion.  Since then, the project has been renamed to
          SVNKit (available at <a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>)
          and has seen great success as a provider of Subversion
          functionality to various Subversion clients, IDE
          integrations, and other third-party tools.</p>
<p>The SVNKit library is interesting in that, unlike the
          javahl library, it is not merely a wrapper around the
          official Subversion core libraries.  In fact, it shares no
          code with Subversion at all.  But while it is easy to
          confuse SVNKit with javahl, and easier still to not even
          realize which of these libraries you are using, folks should
          be aware that SVNKit differs from javahl in some significant
          ways.  First, SVNKit is not developed as open source
          software and seems to have at any given time only a few
          developers working on it.  Also, SVNKit's license is more
          restrictive than that of Subversion.  Finally, by aiming to
          be a pure Java Subversion library, SVNKit is limited in
          which portions of Subversion can be reasonably cloned while
          still keeping up with Subversion's releases.  This has
          already happened once&#8212;SVNKit cannot access BDB-backed
          Subversion repositories via the <code class="literal">file://</code>
          protocol because there's no pure Java implementation of
          Berkeley DB that is file-format-compatible with the native
          implementation of that library.</p>
<p>That said, SVNKit has a well-established track record of
          reliability.  And a pure Java solution is much more robust
          in the face of programming errors&#8212;a bug in SVNKit
          might raise a catchable Java Exception, but a bug in the Subversion core
          libraries as accessed via javahl can bring down your entire
          Java Runtime Environment.  So, weigh the costs when choosing
          a Java-based Subversion implementation.</p>

        contains a code segment (written in C) that illustrates some
        of the concepts we've been discussing.  It uses both the
        repository and filesystem interfaces (as can be determined by
        the prefixes <code class="literal">svn_repos_</code> and
        <code class="literal">svn_fs_</code> of the function names,
        respectively) to create a new revision in which a directory is
        added.  You can see the use of an APR pool, which is passed
        around for memory allocation purposes.  Also, the code reveals
        a somewhat obscure fact about Subversion error
        handling&#8212;all Subversion errors must be explicitly
        handled to avoid memory leakage (and in some cases,
        application failure).</p>

<br class="example-break"><p>This same program in C would need to deal with APR's
        memory pool system.  But Python handles memory usage
        automatically, and Subversion's Python bindings adhere to that
        convention.  In C, you'd be working with custom datatypes
        (such as those provided by the APR library) for representing
        the hash of entries and the list of paths, but Python has
        hashes (called &#8222;<span class="quote">dictionaries</span>&#8220;) and lists as
        built-in datatypes, and it provides a rich collection of
        functions for operating on those types.  So SWIG (with the
        help of some customizations in Subversion's language bindings

      get from running its command-line client or other tools.  It's
      the fact that Subversion was designed modularly and provides a
      stable, public API so that others&#8212;like yourself,
      perhaps&#8212;can write custom software that drives Subversion's
      core logic.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we took a closer look at Subversion's
      architecture, examining its logical layers and describing that
      public API, the very same API that Subversion's own layers use
      to communicate with each other.  Many developers have found
      interesting uses for the Subversion API, from simple repository
      hook scripts, to integrations between Subversion and some other
      application, to completely different version control systems.
