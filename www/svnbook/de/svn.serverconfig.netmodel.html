<a name="svn.serverconfig.netmodel"></a>3.11. Network Model</h2></div></div></div>
<p>At some point, you're going to need to understand how your
      Subversion client communicates with its server.  Subversion's
      networking layer is abstracted, meaning that Subversion clients
      exhibit the same general behaviors no matter what sort of server
      they are operating against.  Whether speaking the HTTP protocol
      (<code class="literal">http://</code>) with the Apache HTTP Server or
      speaking the custom Subversion protocol
      (<code class="literal">svn://</code>) with <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>,
      the basic network model is the same.  In this section, we'll
      explain the basics of that network model, including how
      Subversion manages authentication and authorization
      matters.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="de">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.reqresp"></a>3.11.1. Requests and Responses</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The Subversion client spends most of its time managing
        working copies.  When it needs information from a remote
        repository, however, it makes a network request, and the
        server responds with an appropriate answer.  The details of
        the network protocol are hidden from the user—the client
        attempts to access a URL, and depending on the URL scheme, a
        particular protocol is used to contact the server (see the sidebar <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.wc.sb-1" title="Repository URLs">Repository URLs</a>).</p>

        use.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>When the server process receives a client request, it
        often demands that the client identify itself.  It issues
        an authentication challenge to the client, and the client
        responds by providing <em class="firstterm">credentials</em> back
        to the server.  Once authentication is complete, the server
        responds with the original information that the client asked for.
        Notice that this system is different from systems such as CVS,
        where the client preemptively offers credentials („<span class="quote">logs
        in</span>“) to the server before ever making a request.  In
        Subversion, the server „<span class="quote">pulls</span>“ credentials by
        challenging the client at the appropriate moment, rather than
        the client „<span class="quote">pushing</span>“ them.  This makes certain
        operations more elegant.  For example, if a server is
        configured to allow anyone in the world to read a repository,
        the server will never issue an authentication challenge
        when a client attempts to <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>.</p>
<p>If the particular network requests issued by the client
        result in a new revision being created in the repository
        (e.g., <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>), Subversion uses the
        authenticated username associated with those requests as the
        author of the revision.  That is, the authenticated user's
        name is stored as the value of the
        <code class="literal">svn:author</code> property on the new revision
        (see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.properties.html" title="9.10. Subversion Properties">Abschnitt 9.10, „Subversion Properties“</a>).  If
        the client was not authenticated (i.e., if the server
        never issued an authentication challenge), the revision's
        <code class="literal">svn:author</code> property is empty.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"></a>3.11.2. Client Credentials Caching</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Many servers are configured to require authentication on
        every request.  This would be a big annoyance to users if
        they were forced to type their passwords over and over again.
        Fortunately, the Subversion client has a remedy for
        this—a built-in system for caching authentication
        credentials on disk.  By default, whenever the command-line
        client successfully responds to a server's authentication
        challenge, it saves the credentials in the user's private
        runtime configuration area
        (<code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code> on Unix-like systems
        or <code class="filename">%APPDATA%/Subversion/auth/</code> on Windows;
        see <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea" title="7.1. Runtime Configuration Area">Abschnitt 7.1, „Runtime Configuration Area“</a> for more details
        about the runtime configuration system).  Successful
        credentials are cached on disk and keyed on a combination of the
        server's hostname, port, and authentication realm.</p>
<p>When the client receives an authentication challenge, it
        first looks for the appropriate credentials in the user's disk
        cache.  If seemingly suitable credentials are not present, or
        if the cached credentials ultimately fail to authenticate,
        the client will, by default, fall back to prompting the
        user for the necessary information.</p>
<p>The security-conscious reader will suspect immediately
        that there is reason for concern here.  „<span class="quote">Caching
        passwords on disk?  That's terrible!  You should never do
        that!</span>“</p>
<p>The Subversion developers recognize the legitimacy of such
        concerns, and so Subversion works with available mechanisms
        provided by the operating system and environment to try to
        minimize the risk of leaking this information.  Here's a
        breakdown of what this means for users on the most common
        platforms:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>On Windows 2000 and later, the Subversion client uses
            standard Windows cryptography services to encrypt the
            password on disk.  Because the encryption key is managed
            by Windows and is tied to the user's own login
            credentials, only the user can decrypt the cached
            password.  (Note that if the user's Windows account password
            is reset by an administrator, all of the cached passwords
            become undecipherable.  The Subversion client will behave
            as though they don't exist, prompting for passwords when
            required.)</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, on Mac OS X, the Subversion client stores
            all repository passwords in the login keyring (managed by
            the Keychain service), which is protected by the user's
            account password.  User preference settings can impose
            additional policies, such as requiring that the user's account
            password be entered each time the Subversion password is
            used.</p></li>
<li><p>For other Unix-like operating systems, no standard
            „<span class="quote">keychain</span>“ services exist.  However,
            the <code class="filename">auth/</code> caching area is still
            permission-protected so that only the user (owner) can
            read data from it, not the world at large.  The operating
            system's own file permissions protect the passwords.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Of course, for the truly paranoid, none of these
        mechanisms meets the test of perfection.  So for those folks
        willing to sacrifice convenience for the ultimate in security,
        Subversion provides various ways of disabling its credentials
        caching system altogether.</p>
<p>To disable caching for a single command, pass the
        <code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code> option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -F log_msg.txt --no-auth-cache
Authentication realm: &lt;svn://host.example.com:3690&gt; example realm
Username:  joe
Password for 'joe':

Adding         newfile
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2324.

# password was not cached, so a second commit still prompts us

$ svn delete newfile
$ svn commit -F new_msg.txt
Authentication realm: &lt;svn://host.example.com:3690&gt; example realm
Username:  joe
…
</pre>
<p>Or, if you want to disable credential caching permanently,
        you can edit the <code class="filename">config</code> file in your
        runtime configuration area and set the
        <code class="option">store-auth-creds</code> option to
        <code class="literal">no</code>.  This will prevent the storing of
        credentials used in any Subversion interactions you perform on
        the affected computer.  This can be extended to cover all
        users on the computer, too, by modifying the system-wide
        runtime configuration area (described in <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.layout" title="7.1.1. Configuration Area Layout">Abschnitt 7.1.1, „Configuration Area Layout“</a>).</p>
<pre class="screen">
[auth]
store-auth-creds = no
</pre>
<p>Sometimes users will want to remove specific credentials
        from the disk cache.  To do this, you need to navigate into
        the <code class="filename">auth/</code> area and manually delete the
        appropriate cache file.  Credentials are cached in individual
        files;  if you look inside each file, you will see keys and
        values.  The <code class="literal">svn:realmstring</code> key describes
        the particular server realm that the file is associated
        with:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ ls ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/
5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28
3893ed123b39500bca8a0b382839198e
5c3c22968347b390f349ff340196ed39

$ cat ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28

K 8
username
V 3
joe
K 8
password
V 4
blah
K 15
svn:realmstring
V 45
&lt;https://svn.domain.com:443&gt; Joe's repository
END
</pre>
<p>Once you have located the proper cache file, just delete
        it.</p>
<p>One last word about <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>'s
        authentication behavior, specifically regarding the
        <code class="option">--username</code> and <code class="option">--password</code>
        options.  Many client subcommands accept these options, but it
        is important to understand that using these options does
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> automatically send credentials to the
        server.  As discussed earlier, the server „<span class="quote">pulls</span>“
        credentials from the client when it deems necessary; the
        client cannot „<span class="quote">push</span>“ them at will.  If a username
        and/or password are passed as options, they will be
        presented to the server only if the server requests them.  These
        options are typically used to authenticate as a different user
        than Subversion would have chosen by default (such as your
        system login name) or when trying to avoid interactive
        prompting (such as when calling <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> from a
        script).</p>

</table></div>
<p>Here is a final summary that describes how a Subversion
        client behaves when it receives an authentication
        challenge.</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>First, the client checks whether the user specified
            any credentials as command-line options
            (<code class="option">--username</code> and/or
            <code class="option">--password</code>).  If so, the client will try
            to use those credentials to authenticate against the
            server.</p></li>
<li><p>If no command-line credentials were provided, or the
            provided ones were invalid, the client looks up the server's
            hostname, port, and realm in the runtime configuration's
            <code class="filename">auth/</code> area, to see whether appropriate 
            credentials are cached there.  If so, it attempts to use
            those credentials to authenticate.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if the previous mechanisms failed to
            successfully authenticate the user against the server, the
            client resorts to interactively prompting the user for
            valid credentials (unless instructed not to do so via the
            <code class="option">--non-interactive</code> option or its
            client-specific equivalents).</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>If the client successfully authenticates by any of these
        methods, it will attempt to cache the credentials on disk
        (unless the user has disabled this behavior, as mentioned
        earlier).</p>
